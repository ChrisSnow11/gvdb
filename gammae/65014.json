  "description": "Calvin could easily have been a Gladiator back in the days, that's the first thing that came to my mind when he came to my house. This guy is big and may seem intimidating to some, but don't be fooled.  Under those massive muscles lies a shy country boy who is still trying to adjust to the city life. Calvin likes the outdoors. He is very active, plays all kind of sports and of course, he is very serious about building those muscles and doing competition. Welcome to the city of sin Calvin!",
