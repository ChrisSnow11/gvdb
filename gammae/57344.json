  "description": "I Saw It In Your Eyes opens with the young businessman, Ray Renfro, calling on potential new customers in Prague. A freak accident of a flowerpot falling on his head leaves him nearly dead and robbers steal his clothing, money and identity. Ray is forced to live on the street. Miky Sem plays the lead street urchin who takes great pride in the good luck of finding the dead man. He crows to his cohort, Tommy Gent, and proceeds to give him a good ass-fucking, along with Nathan Love, their third companion.",
