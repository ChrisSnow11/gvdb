  "description": "If Santa was packing this much heat, he'd need a larger sleigh. Packed on Kyle's 6'4? lean frame is a whopping 9? Yule Log that will keep you warm all year long. He has no trouble showing it off, getting it up or firing it off. This thick meaty tree trunk of a cock is so big, not even the Grinch could steal it but after you see it, you'll want to - or at least find a place for it to hide. That's if you can take something this big but hey, 'tis the season to over indulge and what better to go overboard on then a handsome man with a huge cock like this!Looking like the delivery driver or the copy machine repair man in a festive mood, with a boyish twinkle on the squared jawed face of a grown man, he playfully put back on his elf hat as he start to undo those pants, revealing a bulge in those black briefs that doesn't just pack the pouch, the head of his cock literally pushes the fabric out beyond the side of his slim hip.He rubs, caresses and squeezes until he finally hauls it out, a little nervous to show it to a guy but excited at the same time as he that mighty tower is soon rock, dripping and looking like it will tickle himself in the chin! Kyle is equally blessed in the baby making department with a pair of twin, egg sized balls that dance in their smooth sack. All good things must cum to an end and Kyle finishes off with a healthy serving of egg nog! Cheers & Happy Holidays from MenOver30 30.com!",
