  "description": "Not since Johnny Rider has there been a guy this young and talented (it's a switch-hitting pairing, so you get to see his skills both as a top and as a bottom!). How do guys this young get into fisting? He is in his mid-20s, but his talent is that of an old pro. He makes Matthieu's hole sing like a violin, and then he takes Matthieu's huge hand in a way that will make your eyes bug out!",
