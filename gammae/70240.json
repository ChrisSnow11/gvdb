  "description": "Anderson is a Sailor-gone-bad. That's right, kicked out of the Navy for failure to adapt to Navy life. He and I have been hanging out for months now and I've taken so many sets of photos of him and filmed him in so many different scenarios and I've kept it all to myself for my own enjoyment. Anderson is my drinking buddy and whenever he comes over we drink, take pictures, drink some more, talk shit, talk about life in the South as we're both good Southern boys and we film him doing crazy things. I've enjoyed this so much and enjoyed getting to know Anderson on such an intimate level that I've been selfish about sharing him. Tonight, I'm giving you nearly an hour of Anderson in our War Chest Updates to give you an opportunity to get to know this sexy, hung and rowdy Southern boy as I've been so lucky to do.Anderson can hang with me drinking and he can almost hang with me in talking shit. He stays on his toes when he's around me and can you blame him? But, every so often I get lucky with Anderson and am able to talk him into taking things a little further. In this particular video, I talk him into letting me whip his ass with his own belt. And, when you see how hard his cock gets at this suggestion, you'll know exactly what I mean by 'Sailor-gone-bad'. Take a long look at this sexy bad boy and I'm sure you're gonna want to keep him all to yourself, too.",
