  "description": "Our cameraman is meeting with his real estate broker, Sam Cuthan, to visit his future furnished apartment. The place is small but perfect for one person. The first time they met, Sam was in serious need of money and agreed to take his clothes off with a mask on. This time, before signing the official papers, our cameraman asks him if his financial situation has improved and offers him to perform again without the mask.",
