  "description": "Levi and I hit it off the first night we met and little did I know that night he would become one of my favorites along with many of you.I get emails about Levi all the time and since he got out of the Navy and went back home it seems many of you have missed this stud as much as I have. Levi was a country boy who was raised on a ranch and worked hard all his life.After he saw the world via the US Navy he returned to his family ranch where he remains today. Getting to know him was a real enjoyable experience and I'm glad he and I met.",
