  "description": "Getting Close To Cole ...<br />Imagine my jaw dropping as I pull up next to Cole at a stop light with him in the lane to my left. My window is down and I'm staring at him like he's a puppy in the window. He catches me and rolls down his passenger side window. I think he noticed me drooling and decided to give me a better look and it looked as if he were inviting me to an opportunity to speak, so I did. I yelled out, Hey dude what's up man? His radio is loud so he turns it down and yells back What? I said, Pull over so I can talk to you for a minute as I wave a card in the air.<br />The light turns green and he roars off as if he thinks I'm crazy, but as soon as I think he's gone forever his turn signal comes and and he pulls over in a parking lot. I pull up, start chatting him up and in forty-five minutes my phone is ringing with him on the other end. Would you like to go out to dinner and talk over your proposition? he asks? By all means! I say. And from dinner we head back to the beach house where I am in for a pleasant surprise as Cole unleashes one of the largest cocks I've seen since Jordan Sage. And in some way he reminds me of that young, angelic Jordan when I first met him at nineteen. Cole is 5'9, 150 lbs., 22 years old with a dick of death. Enjoy getting to know Cole. I know I sure did.",
