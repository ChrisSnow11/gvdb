  "description": "Perversion runs amok as crazed Grant King, with the assistance of a hooded Cliff Parker, gives Max Holden an enema that leaves him gasping for air. How much can poor Max take? Paralyzed with fear and a questionable desire to please, he surrenders any control to the wicked machinations of the sadistic Mr. King. Grant is in his element as he shimmies a hose up the slaveboy's ass and fills him up with gallons of cool water. Max is beginning to feel bloated and uncomfortable. Only after he's consumed an obscene volume of water is he permitted to let go. Sphincter muscles relaxed, he gushes the water out, emptying his belly and his bladder for long-needed redemptive relief.",
