  "description": "Kyle is a 19-year-old Cleveland native who views this first-time video jack-off as a way to get into modeling. His twin brother was kinda upset when he told him about this, then warned him that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever you do today will bite you in the ass later\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. His girlfriend, on the other hand, is okay saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You only live once\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. These two know what he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capable of because Kyle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jerked off in front of them, and even in front of a bunch of people ... it was a drunken orgy. Uh-huh ... So with their blessings, Kyle is ready to get down and boogie, ready to show us what he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shown them. Immediately he is naked, looking fierce and proud. His torso is smooth and muscled; his legs and asscheeks are covered with a faint coat of fur. He looks real fine as he jacks off, so cool and at ease, standing up, laying back. He strokes himself with a firm grip and then he finishes with an explosive burst of milky spooge that deliciously coats his belly, fingers and still-hard cock. He does not disappoint.Afterthought: Remember that scene from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Blazing Saddles\u00e2\u20ac\u009d when Lili Von Shtupp (the music hall floozie with a speech impediment played by the zany Madeline Kahn) hooks up with the black sheriff (Cleavon Little) and asks, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tell me, schatze, is it twue what they say about the way you people are... gifted? (sound of zipper opening) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, it's twue. It's twue. It's twue, it's twue!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d [And then (in the uncut version before the censors did away with it), he replies, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my elbow.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d lol] Anyway, regarding Kyle from Cleveland, it is twue!",
