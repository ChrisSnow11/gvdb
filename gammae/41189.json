  "description": "Miguel Leonn corners Pete Ross on a huge stone stairway, starting Raging Stallion's most romantic scene of all time. Lit by a fireplace and pillar candles, Miguel and Pete explore each other's rippled bodies, as if searching for gold in the gleaming light. Miguel's long, uncut cock fills Pete's throat, taking him on a vacation he could only dream of! Filmed like a Hollywood movie, this scene is a stunning example of why our studio is known the world over as the master of light! After the oral comes the hardcore as Miguel leads Pete to a lavish bathroom that should be on the cover of Architectural Digest! The blue tile and red backdrops only serve as an accent to a fucking which will leave you panting, wishing you were there in person! Miguel's huge cock never looked bigger and Pete's ass has never been more eager. After huge ropes of cum shoot out of both cocks, the studs shower in the moonlight, backlit and beautiful, their skin shimmering as the water caresses their spent flesh.......(how is that for melodrama!?!)",
