  "description": "Phil is a 19 year old college wrestler who loves sports almost as much as he loves his girls. He tells us his first year in school as a college athlete has been out of control fun, and that he never expected to find so many exciting distractions from his schoolwork.<br />Being the southern gentleman that he is, he told us some stories about how he likes to treat his girlfriends, and he wanted us to let him know if we find anyone who'd be a good match. We don't know why he asked us that because, as you'll see, he doesn't have any problems getting just about any girl he wants.<br />",
