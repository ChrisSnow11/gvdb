  "description": "We've seen Bryce cross the line into new territory when Mike teamed him up with Kasen for some great oral action, but tonight I'm sharing his very first solo with you so you can go back and see just how nervous he was in the very beginning of all this. But, as nervous as he is, he's still full of personality and just dreamy to look at.",
