  "description": "'I want to say one word to you. Just one word. ... Are you listening? ... 'Plastics.' That classic line comes from the film \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Graduate\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and it could just as easily be directed to Falcon Str8men latest standout Bobby South \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccuz he loves his toys. In fact, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had a serious relationship with latex novelties shoved up his bunghole for some time now. What I like about Bobby is that he makes no apologies for what he is or what he does or what he likes. His approach to life is straight-on and direct and this self-confidence is so damn appealing. So let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s watch Bobby at play with a trio of plastics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from a stumpy jellied butt plug to a slick firmer one, and then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an easy graduation to a big black Falconcock. Bobby handles each apparatus with skilled aplomb as he slides them into his hole one after the other while simultaneously jacking off his big piece of meat. After several minutes of deep penetration, and with the thick dildo firmly planted deep inside his ass, Bobby finally climaxes and shoots his load \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a happy boy with his toy.",
