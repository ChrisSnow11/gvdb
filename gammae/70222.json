  "description": "Miguel was a hot as hell fucker that I met at a strip club one night with his buddy Tank (who we posted several weeks back) and they were just visiting post for some training for a couple of days. In fact, the night I met them, they were heading out the very next morning to return to the base they were stationed at. <br /><br />They ended up staying at the house until daybreak so we could film and photograph them. I photographed Miguel then turned him over to Cole for his solo while I photographed Tank. Cole must have really gotten this boy excited as he did one hell of a solo. I was struck by just how damn gorgeous this boy was when I dug this out of the War Chest.",
