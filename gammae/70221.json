  "description": "Tonight we're pulling something extra special out of the War Chest for you. One of the most searched names on Active Duty \u00a0 even to this day is 'Kody' and rightfully so. Kody captured the hearts of many AD fans during his time in front of the camera. This country boy went from 'athletic modeling' to full-on hardcore action in no time flat. Watching him progress was probably one of the most satisfying experiences of my entire career. Kody was a sweet country boy with no hang-ups, no baggage. What you saw was what you got and oh my \u00a0 what a completely beautiful package.<br /><br />Tonight I've dug up a never-before-seen solo video that I shot with Kody when he first started modeling for me where I took him out in the woods and let him do his thing all over a Corvette. Man, what I'd do to be that car.",
