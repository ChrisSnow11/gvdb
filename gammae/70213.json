  "description": "I met Reese this past summer down at the beach house where he had just gotten out of the Navy and decided to hang around the beach and find work in construction after pulling four long years abroad assigned to a ship. Reese is a fellow North Carolina native and he's the classic example of a fun scamp. This guy is a riot. His personality and excellent sense of humor would make anyone want to hang out with Reese, but once you see the dick of death that this ex Navy squid is packing, you'll wanna hang around with him for more than his winning personality.",
