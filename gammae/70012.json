  "description": "TuckerTucker was on a training mission for the Air Troops Reserves for the summer when I met him. He's a referral from Thomas and Josh and what a great referral he turned out to be. Tucker has also done some LIVE Shows and you can catch those in the Active Duty LIVE Archives. Here, we get to see Tucker's very first solo performance in front of the camera. Tucker is into sports. Especially basketball which he played in high school. He also played tennis and was the state champion. He ran track, too. Talk about keeping active, Tucker keeps himself busy. Tucker was in the sixth grade the first time he ever jacked off so he's got lots of experience by now. All that experience pays off in his performance. Tucker has some of the absolute most beautiful blue eyes I've ever seen with the nicest, thickest eyebrows to compliment them. He shares some personal secrets with us about how he jacks off twice a day to stay regular. Tucker is packing a nice, uncut big jewel of a cock and he's about to give it some airtime.",
