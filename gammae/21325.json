  "description": "Desperate to escape his forced servitude, Rob Cryston makes a pact with the devil who arrives in the tantalizing guise of hirsute hunk Joe Magnum. Joe promises to sneak Rob's note out to friends on the outside only if the lowly potato-peeler trades the spuds for the stud. Rob agrees and works his oral magic on the big guy's big cock. The deed is done and Rob hands his supposed champion the rescue note ... but Joe's heroic intentions are bogus and he proves to be nothing but a thieving scoundrel as he trashes the message.",
