  "description": "Today we've got a hot little ex-marine named Chance who's a real bad boy. He's such a bad boy that he didn't seem to fit the mold and was eventually separated from the military for bad conduct. But bad conduct is just what we like most here at Active Duty so we've welcomed him right into the fold. Chance is a tight, compact little devil dog standing only 5'7' and weighing in at about 150 lbs. He's sporting a nice uncut package that will make your mouth water.But first, you gotta get past that sexy smile and those gorgeous (and I mean gorgeous) baby blue eyes that could melt any iced-over heart that came his way. Chance is a lot of fun both in and out of his clothes and you're gonna see a lot more of this marine-gone-bad around here at Active Duty.",
