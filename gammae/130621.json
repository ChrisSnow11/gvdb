  "description": "Manuel Deboxer made his masked debut 10 years ago. I decided to invite him to the same location, 10 years later,  for a video encore. It was a nice reunion and we shared a lot of good memories from our past shootings. This video is for all Deboxer's fans. I'm sure you'll be excited to see him again, like an old buddy you haven't seen in a while. Enjoy!",
