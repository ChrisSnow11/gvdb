  "description": "Wesley is 23-years old and one of our buddy Mike's finds. He likes to  hunt, fish and go camping -- pretty much anything outdoors. If you like a young fella that looks good in a cowboy --  you're in a luck. We know Wesley is a fan of country music, even though he doesn't tell us. How do we know? He's got a ringtone that's pure country: Rodney Atkins' 'The Farmer's Daughter.' (His phone goes off as we start the scene. lol.) Get to know Wesley in his debut solo for us!",
