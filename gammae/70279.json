  "description": "Sometimes when you travel things just work out better than you planned and my latest adventure back east was an example of a perfect trip. Everything went so well and I ended up meeting some of the hottest guys all the way up and down the east coast. I was gone for nearly a month, but it didn't seem like that long at all. Time flies when you're having lots of fun and lots of fun is what we had. I took along Major Wood for the trip and he captured some great photos of all the guys while I did the video work. Together we accomplished much more than we'd imagined. In fact, we'll be gearing up for another trip before we've hardly had time to recover from all the fun we had on this one.<br /><br />As luck would have it, we met a really hot Marine named Derek just two days before he was getting out of the Corps. He's off to college, but that's good news for us because he'll be free to travel and expand his horizons. Derek is one sexy ass Marine and meeting him was such a pleasure. The more I looked at him, the more he reminded me of a very young Richard Gere (think 'An Officer And A Gentleman') and I was totally in love. Those beautiful brown eyes and that smile captivated my attention from the moment he shook my hand and said, 'hello.'",
