  "description": "We spotted remarkable 19-year-old Todd Parker as he was strolling San Diego's cruisy Broadway. It was obvious he was looking for some action, so we moved in and struck up a conversation. He told us he was a Marine on a pass from a nearby base. After complimenting him on his hot good looks, we asked if he'd ever been photographed. He hadn't, at least not like we had in mind; and the idea really turned him on. He agreed to a photo session the following weekend and what resulted of our very rewarding work with this gung-ho young Marine is a power-packed film of a horny young stud really working a superbly muscled physique to a climax you'll remember long after this film is over!",
