  "description": "We first met Vinnie over a year ago when he was a skirt-chasing solider just back on U.S. soil and  horny enough to hum anything that moved, including the mattress and while that sure has changed and that big smile is as shy and bright as ever, he's grown into one fine slab of man with thick meaty legs finally strong enough to support that thick, fat, mushroomed shaped cock! His pecs are rounder, his biceps wider and those twin golden globes of one of the world's most luscious asses is still a beauty to behold! The way that leaking pole juts out of the fly of his boxers, hungry and proud before he finally slides them down, takes a seat, allowing us a very close fly over of those perfect glutes and that no-man's land in between, slapping that thick cock in his hand echoing with the promise of what was to come.We saw the first evidence of that barely containable sexuality when he got him together with Slick and Mauricio in our first every ?Trio jerk Off? but it was when he got him and Mauricio alone for steamy one on  one that their rocked their world and their universe was never the never the same! If you ever wondered how straight guys fall in love and realize they might not be so straight after all, Vinnie tells you how it happened in his own words and shows why Maurcio keeps, errr, cumming back for more!",
