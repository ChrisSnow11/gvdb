  "description": "Scene two brings us back to reality, where Ryder Scott is still raging mad at Cory Miles for striking him and ends up at the home of his artist friend, Rip Stone. He intends to call the police, but when he gets there he finds Stone standing in front of a mirror, naked, covering himself in paint. Scott drops the phone and picks up a paint brush, eager to show Stone a few strokes that get them both rock hard and ready to fuck. These two ripped, hung studs give a whole new meaning to 'art appreciation.'",
