  "description": "The Mummy: Surveying all the tomb adventure is Bryce Pierce, the mummy, who comes to life in a scene that garnered Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Sex Scene nominations. The incredible thing about this scene is that it sounds so strange, but it is perhaps the finest sex performance ever recorded on tape. Rather than comment further, let it suffice to say that this scene is required viewing for all fans of Chris Ward, J.D. Slater, and Raging Stallion Studios. It is a triumph that is universally acknowledged as being as good as porn gets.",
