  "description": "Cheeks bones carved from granite, piercing deep eyes and sun-kissed skin the color of cafe-au-lait, Jason walked through the door and took control of the room.  After dancing for as many bachelorette parties and ladies-only nights as any Chippandale dancer, Jason knew what he had and how to work it.It seemed instantly his shirt was off, his pants were open and there was a meaty,  salami thick dick curving to the right and ready for it's closeup. He looked down and said there were the nine reasons why he should be a CircleJerkBoy. We've met plenty of cocky guys before, but never one who fit the description so literally.He ripped a piece of the frabric from the bandanda on his head, wraapped it around the base of that huge cock, gave it a couple of slaps and was ready to go. He explained when he ties it up, he can hold back for hours and indeed, that was the case. The sun was already going down when he finally untied that cannon to fire a white shower they sprayed clear up to his pecs.",
