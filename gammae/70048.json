  "description": "Cole ... The always popular King Cole announces in this memorable show from January 10, 2006 how Active Duty LIVE had just won Best Webcam at the Cybersocket Web Awards. This FOUR HOUR video reminds us why the LIVE shows over the years have been award-worthy. Not only does it have incredibly hot moments with the guys, but it also reveals just how fascinating a lot of them are. But hold up, let's get back to Cole and his show. Always the trooper, Cole bends, twists and flexes himself into a multitude of positions -- fingering his ass with two fingers and jerking his fucking massive dick (we still cannot -- and will not -- get over just how long, big and thick Cole's cock is. Jeez!). Cole works his dick with lotion and asks the audience if he should go for two this week -- two loads, that is. Midway through the scene Cole fires off a thick load that drips and oozes down his cock. Okay, that's numero uno, Cole says. Clean up on aisle four, clean up. Dink we need a Wal-Mart worker in here. Though he doesn't shoot a second load, Cole does make sure to sufficiently show off his ass to the delight of the chatters.",
