  "description": "ClintClint became a favorite around the Active Duty compound during his LIVE performances as well. He's tall, lean and handsome. He is the epitomy of the American Soldier gone bad. Clint plays guitar like it's nobodies business and drives a big truck. Yum. He's a bit shy when you first meet him in person but once the camera comes on he's all business. Clint and I got to know each other very well and now is your chance to get to know more about him as he takes off his clothes and bears his...uhm...well. We first seen him in action with Chaz in our DVD Hot Zone where the two of them get down to the business of soldier love. Get some unshared time with Clint in his very first solo performance.",
