  "description": "Last Friday, my colleagues organized a Masquerade ball for Halloween. Lots of uninvited guests showed up, but who cares, they all had gorgeous bodies and we already had too much to drink. I was glad I rented a room at a nearby hotel. As I remember, around midnight, I was lying on the couch and I heard someone walking in front of me. I opened up my eyes and saw a shadow. A muscled silhouette dancing inches away from me. I saw part of his face. He wore a mask. Who is that masked stranger? He obviously was at the ball. Why is he here? What is he going to do?",
