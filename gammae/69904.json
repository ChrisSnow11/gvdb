  "description": "Wolf shows offI met Wolf as he stood outside the mall and waited for his ride to pick him up. He was propped against the wall of the building and scanning the parking lot for what seemed both his ride and any potential trouble. I spyed the boy and made my loop around, pulling up beside him (I probably could have been killed) and striking up a conversation that at first he didnt seem all that interested in. I'm not one that is easily scared away though and I persisted in engaging the little badboy in some conversation. The seed was planted and I drove away. A few days later the call comes and we meet.I come to learn in this session that Wolf has been in some trouble in his past and that he was actually ordered into the military as a condition to staying out of jail (Lord do I know how to pick 'em or what?). After some good old charming on my end we finally see that sweet boy inside emerge from that tough guy outer core and this boy is full of loveable sweetness. Just look at that smile! Wolf gets very comfortable in this session and lets down his guard while he gets something else up and off for us.\u00d3",
