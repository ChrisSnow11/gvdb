  "description": "CorrinWhile on a trip to a local store with a friend who wanted me to help him choose a camera to start his own amateur porn company, I was bored with waiting on him to make his choice so I started roaming the store in search of anything more interesting. I went to the printer section and spied our man Corrin. He was wearing a nametag and a bright colored shirt. The first thing I noticed though was his sexy blue eyes. We struck up a conversation and I quickly found out that he was very serious about his part time job. Almost too serious for my taste, but those eyes and that smile kept me listening. I knew this guy was either a soldier just working weekends at this establishment or he was fresh out of the military. Never one to leave anything unanswered, I asked. Yes, he was in fact a soldier and this was just his part time gig. At first, I walked away and thanked him for his help and returned to find my friend still haggling with his camera choice. Finding this scene going straight to the non-productive phase, I asked one of the uneducated camera salesmen if he had a pen and a piece of paper. I started scribbling down my information for our newfound soldier. I went back to his section and gave him my info. Surprisingly later that evening I got a voice message from Corrin that said, Hi, we spoke today while I was at work. I think I'm interested in your modeling offer whatever it may involve. Please give me a call back and we can talk more about what you are looking for. It took me every bit of five minutes to return his call. We set up a time for him to come over and did this solo scene that kicks off our latest release.",
