  "description": "Bobby Williams is out house hunting. Real estate agent MarcWilliams (in a non-sexual role) shows him some homes, and the onehe really likes is owned by Andreas Stich, one of the hottest men onearth. Andreas has had a long movie career in Europe and has beenfeatured in several Cazzo films, as well as in some of the wonderfulcrossover movies of Bruce LaBruce. Andreas is such an amazingman that Chris Ward undertook a major search to find him and fly himto America. Andreas lives in Leipzig in former East Germany, so ittook some work to get him here, But the results were well worth it, asyou will see in this scene. Andreas, you see, has a huge, perfect cockthat stays rock hard as he practically fall into Bobby's ever invitingass. Those rounded mounds would make a straight man crooked!Once again, the fucking is true to Raging Stallion form - which is whywe are the best in the business!",
