  "description": "Doc was a recruit brought to us by the very memorable Tarzan a while back. Doc went on to make a sizzling video with us &nbsp; Soldier's Ball: Bareback Two-Step &nbsp; but his solo turn in this week's Streaming Videos of the Week section was this first time he got in front of the Active Duty cameras.However, this isn't just any old solo. This one was filmed and directed by King Cole by himself, just as he was starting to get the hang of filming scenes. At the time, since Cole was still pretty new at manning the camera, there are some glitches and moments of 'oops' through the scene. However, for you guys that like that whole 'fly on the wall' aspect to videos like this &nbsp; this one is for you. At some points in the video, when Cole and Doc thought the camera was turned off, we get to hear Cole direct Doc and hear what they are really thinking. Doc is so eager to please Cole in this solo and it completely shows &nbsp; guys, this one you gotta check out!",
