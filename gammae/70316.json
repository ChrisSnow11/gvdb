  "description": "Isn't it nice to have things you can depend on? Tonight I'm very excited about our War Chest Update and I think you're going to fall as head-over-heels as I did for this one. He's super handsome and super masculine but ready to explore and things have been moving fast with our boy Ransom.We all know AD's beloved Jack (of Jack and Dane infamy) and what a character he is. Jack is always looking for new talent to bring on board and have a good time with and Ransom seemed a likely candidate for Jack's quest. Jack worked his magic slow with Ransom and it paid off big time! By the time I was introduced to Ransom, Jack had him broken in already. While I was out of town recently Jack took Ransom over to Major Wood's place to take a few pictures to send to me. When I saw the pictures I immediately got on the phone and told Jack what a hot piece of man he'd found. I told him to keep working on him until I got back home and we'd see where things were at when I returned.The night I boarded my flight to return home I got a text message with a picture of someone sucking a cock. It was from Jack and the tattoo on the guy's stomach that he was blowing in the picture matched the tat on Ransom's stomach. I was rudely told by the stewardess to shut down my phone, but all the way home I was excited about Jack's success.",
