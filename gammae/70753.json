  "description": "Meet new recruit Ajay!<br /><br />This super-tall dude (he's 6'4'!) has got a deep voice, big ol' muscular thighs and a winning smile.<br /><br />Kaden, who shot this video, jokes with Ajay at the beginning of the scene, saying that he's so tall, he can't fit him into the frame. Now, that *almost* sounds like my tales about my 'wide angle lens' being broken, but I don't think Kaden was kidding this time. lol.<br /><br />Ajay is just 19-years old and weighs in at 215 lbs. He looks like he just came off a college football field -- he's *that* guy.<br /><br />He's also talented with his hands -- in that he plays the guitar, and sings too. Everything from covers of hip-hop to Jason Mraz. He's a well-rounded guy! Kaden badgers him a bit into singing, but he can't convince him to hum a tune -- alas. <br /><br />Kaden suggests that Ajay hop in the shower and lather up, because 'us fans' like to watch. You'll have to watch for yourself to see how it ends, but Kaden himself says it was 'awesome,' so you know it's gotta be good!",
