  "description": "There was a guy like Jay in every school: the skinny little punk with the ink and denim jacket, and what he lacked in size, he made up for with attitude. Then one day, you were next to him at the urinal and once your eyes saw those nine, thick, meaty inches hanging out of his jeans, you wanted to drop to your knees, and even if you choked to death on something that huge, you would have felt your life was complete.He stripped out of his shirt and shucked off his wife beater like a man who could not wait to get naked. His thin, white frame was decorated with tats and a nice batch of hair in the center with a very happy trail pointing to a lump in his pants that said his cock was as ready for action as he was. He arranges and rearranges that meat, reaching deep into his shorts before revealing a thick brown bush, a swollen, fuzzy set of balls and a thick cock that even while soft was longer than many a guy's full blown erections...and we're just getting to the good part.Soon all nine inches are standing at attention and looking even thicker on his slender frame.  Skinny Jay strokes a pole so long and so wide, it seems like he's fisting a flesh colored thermos rather than his cock.  Perhaps it's the confidence in knowing how well hung he is, but it's even hotter seeing him work his meat under a totally untrimmed bush; when you are hung this big, you don't need to shave your pubes to try and make your cock look bigger.  Jay comes through and in the end, our punk gets spunked, and we have a feeling he just might inspire you to do the same.",
