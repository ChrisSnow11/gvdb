  "description": "It's straight up cowboy country so get your boots on and saddle up 'cause we've got two hot buckaroos that are grabbin' their bulls by the horn and they're gonna take you on a ride that'll leave you standing in the bleachers yellin' yeehaw and beggin' for more. By the time Maverick and Haws are done with you, your heart'll be doin' the two-step.We've scored big tonight and brought home the gold with two real McCoy's who will tell you right quick they ain't no 'department store' cowboys. They're the real deal. They like workin' on their trucks and riding horses and all the stuff guys like to do when they're raised on a farm, not a cul-de-sac. Their fun starts where the black top ends.But even with all that hype what's really special about tonight's War Chest Update is just how damn cute these two are. Maybe it's Maverick's adorable little ass that he loves to show off or maybe it's Haws' genuine down home attitude and the way they interact together. I don't know, I'm getting old and romantic but you get my drift, right? There's something special here.When Maverick showed up for this shoot, he had a buddy in tow, and I'm introduced to Haws. This is where things got interesting. I'm not gonna spoil it for you, troops, but trust me this is one dual of the guns that you don't wanna miss. If you wanna get your whistle wet before the show check out the Gallery Updates and get a taste then gallop on over to the War Chest Update and throw your boots up.",
