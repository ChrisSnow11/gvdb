  "description": "You'd think after all these years, I'd get jaded after seeing so many beautiful men walk through my door.<br /><br />Not so!<br /><br />And that's proven very well this week with the drop-dead gorgeous Dakota in our War Chest Update.<br /><br />Now, you met him this past Sunday in our Videos Of The Week section when we debuted his scene with his Justin and Joel. But tonight, you're getting your formal introduction this fine specimen of a man in the War Chest.<br /><br />This guy is a rascal, let me tell you. He's open-minded and got a bit of a devilish side to him. A point well-proven in the first few minutes of his scene in the War Chest, as he talks about an 'interesting' time he had with a buddy of his that you've already met \u00a0 Braden! Turns out, Dakota picked him up while jogging one day and was all, 'so, how open-minded are you?' LOL. My, troops, how some things change \u00a0 but some things always stay the same!<br /><br />Well, as we said last week, the very same day we all met each other, Braden found himself on the end of some helpful 'fluffing' from Dakota. Oh yes, we've got some good vibes about this new recruit. This guy can be aggressive when he wants something, and evidently that night, he wanted Braden. And we're so glad he did. Heh.<br /><br />I can tell you this: you'll be seeing a lot of our new pal Dakota in the future, mark my words!",
