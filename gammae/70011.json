  "description": "LanceWe've all met Lance on his several Active Duty LIVE shows in the recent past. Lance is beautiful, playful and as country as they come. Lance is a lot of fun. He's confident, cocky and in his own words 'a competitive motherfucker'. Lance is 6' and weighs 185 lbs., he enjoys working out, wakeboarding and playing tennis and basketball. He's from Augusta, Georgia. This guy has spent a lot of time in the gym honing what is nearly a perfect body. I was in a hurry the day we shot this video so we shot it in Lance's bedroom at his apartment. Lance is extremely talkative in his solo...talking to the camera as if you were right there sitting in a chair next to him. He wants to please you. Lance stays rock hard during the entire performance and seems very into showing off for the camera. Lance likes to get head for his wake-up call. Listening to him tell you his fantasies about what you could be doing to him will send you over the edge. If it doesn't then you've never been to the edge.",
