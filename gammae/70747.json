  "description": "Meet new recruit James!The super handsome fella (who I swear kind of reminds me of Ryan Reynolds if you squint a little) is 25-years old and hails from the wilds of Montana. He stands at a strapping 6'1' tall and weighs just over 200 pounds.He was raised on a farm -- go figure! -- and he likes to hunt, fish and work with horses a lot. You can tell that he's got a naturally fit body on him -- one that seems real outdoor work and physical activity. (Though he does work out at the gym a lot.)Guest director Mike jokes that James is a 'real cowboy,' and James agrees, laughing, and says 'I guess you could say so!' James says he's a little bit nervous, but that disarming smile tells me otherwise. This guy is a stunner, and I think you're gonna like him a lot.This is the first of what I hope will be more from James -- you hear me Mike?",
