  "description": "<b>Transmission Overhaul</b> - Steve Cannon makes his RagingStallion world premiere bent over on his knees as hot, hunky, hairyEnglishman Brock Devonshire shoves his hand up Steve's chute. Nowarm-up, no foreplay, just fisting from start to finish! Steve hasappeared in butt play movies before, but he has never given this kindof performance. He gets <b><i>pounded</i></b> for so long that heactually wears out his top. Brock tries to follow Steve's swelteringlyhot ass as he stands up on the workbench for one of the best fistingscenes ever filmed. With Brock exhausted, Steve entices Rik Jammerinto the fray for a four fist three way that sets the sloppy tone for therest of the movie. Just one of this scene's amazing shots: as Stevegets pummeled in succession by these two experienced mechanics,he holds his quivering ass open, the American flag tattooed down hisarm and the words 'Sinner' stenciled in permanent ink right above hisgaping, greedy hole. No music here: if loose lips can sink ships, thenon-stop filth that spews forth from Steve's foul mouth would send theentire fifth fleet under the waves. No other fisting film has ever had anopening scene like this - Steve Cannon's performance makes him anew Fisting Superstar!",
