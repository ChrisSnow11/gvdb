  "description": "Paul's Back For Another Solo ... Paul shows up in his dress blue pants and decides to give Mike a quick solo before he runs back off to a rehearsal for a parade. This big country boy reminds me of Hoss. A lot. He's beefy, he's country and you can tell he's hungry. He strokes out a nice load for Mike before he's off, but he'll be back later to meet up with Alex.",
