  "description": "Tonight I am very excited to bring you a guy I've been holding onto for awhile for our War Chest Update. Help me welcome one rough, tough, built-like-a-brick-shithouse US Marine named Dorian! Dorian is the epitomy of the posterboy for the USMC. He's 6'1' tall and 200 lbs. of rock-solid muscle and he's sporting the tats to prove his authenticity.I've gotten to know Dorian very well over the last couple of months and have enjoyed having him live here with me until he deploys soon. And, I've managed to get Dorian in some serious hardcore action with some other newbies we've discovered lately as well as some of our veteran favorites. Dorian is all man and he's comfortable with his sexuality. He doesn't have a problem being on top or bottom of any hot mansex pile-up you can throw together. He's always eager to please and he succeeds. It's been an honor getting to know this stud. He's a complete gentleman &nbsp; all the way down to opening my car door for me when we go out and driving me whenever we go to dinner. He's treated me like royalty. Please help me welcome Dorian to the Active Duty family and stay tuned for his hardcore debut coming to Active Duty very soon.",
