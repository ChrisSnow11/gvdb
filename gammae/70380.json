  "description": "Grant is a young fella that Kaden found at the gym one day (go figure) and our special recruiter worked his magic and found himself a new model! Turns out, Grant was the very FIRST model Kaden ever recruited. So you guys are witnessing a special kind of history tonight!In Kaden's words:'I had never seen Grant in the gym before, and there was a subconscious pull I had for him. I just knew that I had to approach him and make small talk. He was on the flat bench and was working out with dumbbells by himself. So immediately I asked him if he needed a spot. He said yes, and I had no problem putting his head between my legs and reaching over to 'help him out.' I was wearing some thin wind pants and was hoping that I did not get an erection while my dick was near his face. My dick was so close to his mouth that I could feel the warm air off his breath as he threw up the weights.Grant was the first guy I had ever approached and asked to film. Surprisingly he was very open to the idea, I was expecting a right hand to the face. He agreed to do a solo for me, and I was so excited to begin my new adventure into production. When he started to take off his clothes and show off that finger licking good body, I almost fell over. If it wasn't for the tripod, I would have been shooting the floor the entire time. Grant is my first, and he is special to me. So stick around and be ready for a fight, because I am not letting this one go so easy!'",
