  "description": "Michael is the boy next door that actually seems like an attainable fantasy. Michael says he decided to give this a try because it sounded interesting and fun.He's 21, 5' 9', I'd guess he weighs about 150 lbs. He played baseball and ran track in high school before joining the military. He's bright-eyed and ready for fun and it's obvious how horny he is when I walk out of the room. In his streaming solo video in the War Chest, after only a minute he's got his cock out of his jeans, stroking it and it doesn't take long before he's at full attention. He pays plenty of attention to the camera and makes you want to jump right in there with him and have fun, too. And that ass, oh my. He shows off that pretty furry butt and gives us plenty to look at. When he shoots his load he does some nifty thing where he wraps his arm around his leg and - well, you just have to see it. Once he's shot, he yells out 'whooooooo!' and we all laugh in the other room. I entice Joey and Able to come in and see by telling them he came all over his face. They fell for it and then I tell Michael they just wanted to see him naked and he agrees. It was a fun night.Michael has been to Iraq and is a prime example of what it means to be part of his generation and serve this country. What I love most about these guys is that they put their asses on the line regardless of whether the wars they fight are right or wrong. In their eyes, serving their country and protecting our freedom is the right thing to do. And if they think they can bring freedom and liberation to someone who has spent all their lives being repressed then that makes it even more worth it. It is this outlook that we need more of in this world.",
