  "description": "Garret was actually the Marine that got the card that Hunter took the time to call. He and Hunter had decided that it was all bullshit. They were actually sitting side-by-side when Hunter made the call. It took me about thirty minutes and several call backs to convince these two that this was real. Once they arrived I was instantly crazy about Garret. Why? Cause he's 5'7' and 145 lbs. and I like em short. They say dynamite comes in small packages and Garret is no exception. He works us good in this scene as we get to know more about this country boy.<br /><br />(Scene 3 of 5 in 'Devil Dawg Dick.')",
