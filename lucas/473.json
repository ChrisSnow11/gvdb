  "description": "Unable to sleep, Blu Kennedy stares at the ceiling of his dorm room. Is he worried about midterms, or is he anticipating the return his hot Latin roommate Danny Bitho? College students learn many lessons behind closed doors, but that is an understatement here. Danny returns in the still-dark early morning hours and starts to beat his meat as Blu watches. When Danny realizes Blu is awake, he turns on the light and confronts him. Danny can sense what Blu really wants and lures him into a learning experience he will never forget.",
