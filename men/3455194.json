  "description": "When fit young stud Beaux Banks wakes up next to his best friend Mason Lear, he naturally assumes that they must have had sex the night before. Mason hears Beaux giving himself a pep-talk in the bathroom and decides that he's not going to let Beaux's gay panic go unpunished, spinning an elaborate lie about a night of torrid passion that never happened. When tall, dark-haired Mason realizes that maybe Beaux's panic is something more like wishful thinking, the two decide that it doesn't have to be a lie after all. The two athletic hunks tenderly kiss before passionately tearing into each other, making up for lost time in an intimate and erotic scene.",
