  "description": "The Abbey continues with Paul Walker playing Lord Martin, the master of the house, who intends to throw a party in the hopes of finding a suitor. The night of the party Lord Martin finds himself bored out his mind. He retires to his study to be alone and is served a drink by the footman James, played by Daniel Johnson. The party continues while Lord Martin hides out and requests a dance from footman James. The music plays and the dance turns into a sultry tango. Their bodies move closer and closer to one another until the master kisses his servant.",
