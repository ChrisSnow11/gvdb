  "description": "Men.com's first collaboration with iconic queer erotic illustrator Tom of Finland takes things back to Tom's early days in 1957. Birdwatcher Theo Brady catches a glimpse of fisherman Kurtis Wolfe through the trees and snaps a few pics before getting out his big cock as he watches the burly stud. Kurtis catches his watcher in the act, but no sooner than Theo starts sucking Kurtis's cock, the sound of a siren pierces the air, and Theo and Kurtis scatter as police officer Matthew Camp stalks through the woods brandishing his nightstick. Theo can't believe his eyes when he spies Matthew eating Kurtis's ass and fucking him doggystyle, and the pair entice the shy twitcher from the woods to take photos as Kurtis rides Matthew's cock before joining their threesome for some double penetration!",
