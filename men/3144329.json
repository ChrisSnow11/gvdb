  "description": "Blue-eyed Blaze Austin just got a call from his hunky and upset boyfriend, Brandon Evans, who just informed him he\u2019s quitting his job. Muscular Blaze dabbles in a bit of magic, and creates a paper doll version of fit Brandon so he can remove his anger and make him feel better. Brown-haired Brandon can\u2019t believe what\u2019s happening to his body as Blaze manipulates the paper doll, but whatever he\u2019s doing is definitely working!",
