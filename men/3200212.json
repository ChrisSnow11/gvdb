  "description": "Athletic mechanic Paul Canon has to break some bad news to muscular Julian Knowles about his totaled car. Julian can't afford the repairs to get his car up and running, but he's got some ideas about an alternative payment plan. Julian spreads his thick ass for Paul, letting the greased-up mechanic rim and finger his tight hole until he's begging to get pounded right there in the garage.",
