  "description": "Today\u00b4s client wanted our meeting to take place in a restaurant close to his home. I was quite sure that he wanted to avoid his parents or his girlfriend to notice his debts. But I was mistaken. He just had a meeting (probably with another loan-company) before. And he had lunch. Lucky boy. But as it got quite cold already we decided to have our little conversation in his apartment. An unfriendly place - almost no furnitures. He obviously just moved in. His debts have been quite low. But still he was desperate. I went straight to the point offering my anti-debt-service for some sexual reward. He took it with humor but refused. Instead he asked for our normal loan conditions. Well, I told him that after all I\u00b4ve seen he didn\u00b4t look too trustworthy for a normal loan... what would he do?",
