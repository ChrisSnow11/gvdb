  "description": "Young Czechs really like to study abroad. The United Kingdom is probably the most preferred  country, mainly because of the language. This boy dreamed of studying in Scotland. He even got to a university. He was thrilled at first, then he started to realize that the fee is too steep for him to afford it. His parents managed to pay half of it, getting the other half was up to him. He chose what seemed to be the easiest way: he decided to take a loan. I wasn\u00b4t overly enthusiastic about lending money to someone who would have been thousands of miles away. The boy was cute enough so I tried my dirty tricks on him. He was ambitious, he wanted to follow his dream. To do that, he had to follow me into his be. I wasn\u00b4t going to lend him a single Crowns. I wanted to have fun.",
