  "description": "I don\u2019t understand why some people want to live in a giant block of flats buildings. I would feel like a trapped animal. Well, this guy didn\u2019t mind. Maybe because the flat was actually quite nice and not that expensive to rent. But the boy did what many young Czechs do: he had a steady job so he spent all his money and took some loans. Then he got fired. And his girlfriend, too. They started to sink deeper and deeper into debts. And I was supposed to save them both. He looked nice and well-dressed, so why shouldn\u2019t I help him? Obviously he didn\u2019t tell her about me, he wanted to be the one who saved the day. A white knight saving damsel in distress. All joking aside, he did save them both, eventually. But it was a long and hard way to get there. But he managed.",
