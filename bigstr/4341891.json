  "description": "Ladronka is a very nice park in Prague, very popular amongst young rollerbladers. I was very successful there in the past, as some of you might remember. This time I looked for exhibitionist types. They\u00b4re easier. I found one working-out right there in the open. As I expected, he had no problem talking to a stranger so we had a very nice chat. He was fairly young and still unsure of himself. He worked in a job far below his potential and he wasn\u00b4t really willing to do something about it. I tried to talk some sense into him but wasn\u00b4t really successful. I felt like he needed that push that would send him on the right track. That\u00b4s why I offered him to work for me as a special kind of assistant for times of need. But he had to go through a very difficult job interview first.",
