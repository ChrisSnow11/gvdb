  "description": "I wanted to get out of Prague and hunt some innocent farm boys. I have a friend who lives in a small town east of Prague so I went there hoping I could use his flat in case I got lucky. I started on the main street and soon bumped into Radek. He wasn't a farm boy but an elevator builder and a vintage truck repairman in his spare time. It sounded like an interesting combination but also made me worried he might be well-off. I was wrong because he responded quite well to my offers. The boy had a pretty good body, that's what working with machines gives you. I even made him to exercise, I wanted to have a proper look at his body in motion. Then I took him to my friends' place. I didn't expect that his girlfriend would be there so we had to do it in the bathroom. A bit uncomfortable but still great fun.",
