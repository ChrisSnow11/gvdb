  "description": "I went hunting on the Wenceslas Square today. It\u00b4s a tricky area, sometimes all you can find are tourists, sometimes you meet a nice boy. Actually I met two tourists, Vasek was Czech and Michal was Slovak. They were friends on a trip to Prague. What are the odds! We started chatting and had a great fun. When you\u00b4re from east, Prague can be a bit expensive. The boys had been saving money for this trip for a long time. They rented a nice private apartment to save cash for parties. I went easy on them at first, a friendly kiss for starters. Both of them were hungry for money and willing to experiment. So I convinced them to take me to their apartment where the real fun started. I doubt the boys will tell their friends about this lovely Monday morning in Prague.",
