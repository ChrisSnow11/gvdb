  "description": "I think, I really saved this boy. He already owed the rent for two months and the next payment was due that very day. In the Czech Republic, owner can kick tenant out after three missed payments. On top of that, he borrowed 5 000 from a loans-hark and was supposed to pay back 11 000. The boy was a hard worker but not even two jobs would have saved him in this situation. But of course I helped him. I am a nice guy, but when I\u00b4m in a mood for something special, I don\u00b4t think twice. I hope you guys enjoy getting rimmed as much as I do. This thing can bring people together like nothing else. The boy tried very hard to please me. You do everything when your life is at stake. Even if it\u00b4s beyond your imaginations.",
