  "description": "The deal is easy: You need money? Ok, so we visit you at home. Alone. And be aware: we have a camcorder to \"document a correct counseling\". So far so good. But what happens if I cannot visit the \"client\" at home because his parents are there? Well, I agreed to meet him in a bar in his neighborhood. He felt quite uncomfortable talking about his debts already there. I told him to go to my hotel room (which was nothing more but an hour-hotel ;-). He somehow noticed in what kind of establishment he finally was and felt even more uncomfortable.
