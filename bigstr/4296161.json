  "description": "In front of a hospital I almost bumped into a guy looking at his cellphone. He had a bandaged arm, which looked like a nice conversation opener. It turned out that he got injured in the warehouse where he worked. In the Czech Republic you don\u00b4t get sickness benefits for the first three days of the sick leave. Which can be very difficult for some people. Fillip, that was the boy\u00b4s name, was more than happy to show me some skin to compensate for the lost money. His beautiful chest was worth much more than 500 I paid him. I could say he wasn\u00b4t gay, he went through a break-up some time ago, so I had to thread carefully. Was this sweet and innocent angel greedy enough to get really dirty?",
