  "description": "I got out of subway and saw a young guy buying food. It was a very hot day so he didn\u00b4t have too much clothes on. It\u00b4s summer holidays in the Czech Republic, that\u00b4s why this young student was willing to talk. He had almost too much time on his hands and was bored. He was a typical Czech student: lazy and broke. Summer part-times were just necessary evil to make money for parties. I totally understood, it\u00b4s much more fun to chill out than work hard. He was very shy and looked so innocent. Still, when I offered him money that would last for the rest of the holidays, he was more than willing to listen. Why bother going to work three times a week when you can earn much more just by doing some nasties with an friendly pervert like me?",
