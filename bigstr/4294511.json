  "description": "Sun was shining and I decided to visit the Petrin. This is a famous hill in Prague which is also a park and highly frequented by tourists but also by many youngsters. Mainly couples but still I wanted to try my luck. After not even 20 minutes I found the perfect match for this day. A student boy from Brno visiting his girlfriend in Prague. He didn\u00b4t have a part-time job and was even living with his parents. The only thing was that he claimed to not have time because he was supposed to meet his girlfriend within the next half hour. But when I showed him the money in my locket I was sure to get his full attention. A few moments later she receive a text message that he missed the train :-) Now I had him only for me. He was nervous and shy. But a great catch.",
