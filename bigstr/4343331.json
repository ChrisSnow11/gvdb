  "description": "I love after Christmas time. It\u00b4s because of presents. Needles presents that make boys go into debt only to impress their better halves or friends. Boys like this one. He was a former professional hockey player, he got injured and had to end his short career. He struggled to get a new job ever since. And the debts started to pile up. Which didn\u00b4t discourage him from taking a consumer loan to buy a new TV and a new phone as a Christmas present for his girlfriend. What a lovely gesture. Of course she had no idea about financial problems that were about to crush their dream life together. For some reason I felt sorry for the guy, so I even offered him 2 000 more than he needed. After a moment of hesitation he finally agreed.",
