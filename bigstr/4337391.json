  "description": "I don\u00b4t like when people are late for our meetings. It always makes me think twice to even listen to their stories. This guy almost forgot about the meeting. I was annoyed a little bit but decided to give him a chance. Mainly because he went out jogging, which I thought was an acceptable excuse for being late. He may even have a nice body, I thought. When he arrived, I was quite pleased by his politeness and a fit body. Our boy got kicked out of his ex-girlfriend\u00b4s apartment and needed 40 000 to get back on feet. I heard him out and decided that it would be too risky to lend him anything. Instead, I offered him an \"unofficial\" solution to his problems. And by god, it was a great idea! His body was simply stunning, I\u00b4m sure he exercised almost every day. I couldn\u00b4t wait to get inside.",
