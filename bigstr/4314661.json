  "description": "This guy had very interesting qualification and job experience. He successfully studied to be a carpenter but worked mainly in chemical industry. He wanted to work as a carpenter, he wanted to be creative. But a chemical plant at his doorstep provided a stable job. I think he was lucky when the plant was bought by a new owner who started sacking the staff. This misfortune brought this freshly unemployed young man into Prague and in front of my table. From the start, I could tell he was very confident and focused on what he wanted. This time, he was after a carpenter job. And he was going to get one. I had precisely the job he dreamed of. Now it was only the question of how much did he want the job. And how much extra money would he like to make.",
