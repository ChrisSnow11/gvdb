  "description": "I decided to go on a long walk in my favorite park in Prague. I wanted to clear my head but I kept my eyes open and the camera on standby, just in case. On my way back I turned the camera on and started hunting for real. It took almost 15 minutes before I found anything worth mentioning. Two young guys kite running. I tried my luck and got into a conversation with them. They were a little on edge, probably thinking I was some pervert ruining their day-off. My offers made then even more nervous but I was making progress, slowly. The boys were roommates living nearby. Obviously, my head was full of brilliant ideas what to do with them. Who would have thought they might let me realize every single one of them? This was a glorious afternoon.",
