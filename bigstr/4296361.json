  "description": "I hate this transition. Some call it fall, I call it \"from summer to winter.\" I feel lazy and without any energy. Gathered some energy, switched on my Cam and went out to hunt. I\u00b4ve met the special one close to Ujezd, nice part of Prague, just down the Petrin tower. Cute and scared boy he was. But he didn\u00b4t have any problems talking to a stranger like me. He lived with his mother and works in a bistro, for just 7,000 CZK per month. This low salary I couldn\u00b4t even imagine. Well that\u00b4s a reality and this reality helps me a lot to persuade this young fellows to accept my dirty offers all the time. Well, almost... This one was no exception, for 2,000 I saw his dick and then it was very easy to get him into the hotel room where I could play with him as much as I wanted to.",
