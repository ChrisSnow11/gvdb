  "description": "And the show continues. On this glorious sunny Friday, I\u2019ve picked a young pal from Holesovice. It took me some time to find his apartment so I hoped it\u2019s gonna be worth it. As soon as we entered the lift I got scared cause it looked dodgy and not really reliable. But I survived and my mood got way better cause I knew that I am gonna have fun very soon. I was confident cause he looked desperate. His place has been nice and tidy. I knew that there has to be a girl living with him and I was right. He had a girlfriend. After we summed up his debts I gave him my proposal. He was very nervous and scared so I told him to call his girlfriend for advise. That was a risky move, cause she could change his mind about what was about to come.",
