  "description": "My friend Jiri from Czechhunter told me that students always need money. When he is hunting fresh meat on the street students are usually an easy catch. That\u00b4s why I was surprised that no student called me so far. But today it happened. The boy already told me on the phone that he came to Prague to study and that he has now problems to afford his flat. I would consider myself as clever but my parents didn\u00b4t have the money to send me to university. Well, so I was eager to come into contact with this species the first time. The guy was friendly and open-minded. And a sportsman after all. He tried to appear cool and relaxed but he was far away from home and desperate. A good match for our agency.",
