  "description": "This boy had a little affair at work and his girlfriend found out about it. She left him to think and decide what he really wanted. He got three days to decide while she was staying at her parents. On the first night, our guy was very angry and confused so he went out with friends. They partied pretty hard and decided to race with their cars. Our boy was driving his girlfriend\u00b4s car and crashed it. Nothing serious but he needed money for the repair quickly. He was certain that his girlfriend would break up with him for good if she knew what kind of idiot he was. He still loved her very much, that was obvious. Was his love strong enough to accept my dirty proposition? As you can tell, he was willing to do anything I asked him to do. That\u00b4s how strong love can be.",
