  "description": "When this boy called me, he repeatedly mentioned his desire to leave his flat. He was very unhappy, I could tell from his voice. What a crybaby, I thought. I had no idea. The poor boy lived in a run-down apartment building in a poor part of Prague. I couldn\u00b4t believe my eyes. There were holes in walls, a mess on the floor, mould everywhere. The stench was unbearable. I almost wanted to run away. But the boy was cute and really needed my help. He wanted 30 000 to start a new life elsewhere. After paying up his debts to the current owner, he would rent a better flat. I was almost happy to help him to get out of that hellhole. But life isn\u00b4t fair. He had to work very hard to earn my help. Business and fun come first, compassion last. As you all know, this is not a charity.",
