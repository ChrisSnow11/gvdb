  "description": "I liked this guy. He was really nice and polite. And he didn\u00b4t do anything foolish apart from not having adequate savings. He took a car loan and one month later he lost his job. He was able to handle things by selling his stuff away but eventually he hit the bottom. When I got there he owed for rent, for a car, and for medical insurance. Not to mention debts to his friends. A very undesirable situation. From his point of view, of course. I was ready to take full advantage of his misfortune. His well-built physique was really turning me on from the beginning. So I immediately offered him my generous help. I couldn\u00b4t wait to hear the tough guy moaning. I knew it was going to be worth of every single Crown.",
