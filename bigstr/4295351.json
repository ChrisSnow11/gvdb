  "description": "The funny thing about my hobby is that you never know where you will meet the right boys. Sometimes you find them on the street lounging around, sometimes in a club or a pub and sometimes even in a bus. Yes, and every now and then even in a supermarket. As you know me already I never leave my home without my little cam so that I am always ready. Two days before I just finished my last private movie when I saw a super cute boy in the market. I had no intention to find someone this day but he appeared so lost in this shop looking for some food so I had to try my luck. He was open minded and incredibly funny. And above all: more broke than he wanted to admit in the first place.",
