  "description": "This poor guy got injured at work. Normally he would get sickness benefits and perhaps some compensation from his employer. He should have been just fine. Except he worked \"under the table\", unreported employment. So he got no benefits from the state and only thing he got from his employer was a boot in his ass. It took months to recover from the injury, he had no income so he sunk into debts. I think his girlfriend would have helped him if she knew about his situation but he was too proud to tell her the truth. He was a tough gangsta style guy, who wouldn\u00b4t take orders from anyone. Why should he worry? 45 000 debt and the immediate threat of eviction finally made him a bit concerned so he called me for help. For such an amount I wasn\u00b4t going to be nice.",
