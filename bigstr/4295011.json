  "description": "My original intention was to go to a club and search for some boys there. I was just about to take the tram when I saw this cute guy. He seemed to be in his mid-20s. I started a short conversation with him and somehow I fell in love with his magic smile. But the best thin was that the tram was late and we were almost alone. So I decided to just try my little games. He was friendly but he rejected all my offers. Well, he had a job already so maybe that was the reason why. So I had to increase my offers significantly. But as I was always sure my whole life - money makes people change their opinion. Well, what can I say? We ended in my small favorite hotel room (which I call my winter-love-nest :-)",
