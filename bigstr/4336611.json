  "description": "As it is getting colder and colder, I started the hunt in the metro station today. It didn\u2019t take too long until a young looking, blond guy caught my attention. He didn\u2019t seem to be happy when I ap-proached him\u2026 maybe because of my camera, but when I offered him 2000 crowns he agreed to give me a short \u201cinterview\u201d. From that moment onwards, he became sort of an \u201copen book\u201d: he was coming from Ostrava; he didn\u2019t like his job there, and wanted to check out Prague. Maybe he was even thinking of searching for a job here, but he quickly added that everything here was more ex-pensive than in his home city. No doubt about that. Luckily, I had a nice offer for him. Would he be willing to show me his body? Moreover, if so, how far would he go?",
