  "description": "I met already the most different kinds of people. But this one was very special. He looked good and seemed to be also intelligent. Even though he didn\u00b4t have a full-time job he somehow manage to live in the apartment with his girlfriend. And as I found out he even had a second \"girlfriend\". Indeed he was a casanova with his eyes and smile... even I was somehow fascinated. He had a lot of debts. More than 40 000 CZK. And when I offered him the money in exchange for one hour of good sex he was rather shocked than happy and rejected. But I was somehow fascinated by his magic that I offered him more money than he asked for. And I could see that he started to think again. Would he be the lover in bed that some girls obviously love him for?",
