  "description": "The entry to the house looked like a construction-site and I had to take care not to get my suit messed up. And then the elevator was not working so I was a bit exhausted when I reached the top-floor where my client lived. I really wasn\u00b4t in the best mood when I entered his place. The apartment itself was small but nice. he lived there together with his girlfriend. The rent was 12 000 crowns per month - a lot of money for a young couple. Especially when only one of them is working. His debt summed up to a small fortune. More than I usually offer. But he had a cute face and since I was already climbing up all the stairs I wanted to get some reward. He was friendly and open-minded. But how would he react if I told him that I want sex in return for my help?",
