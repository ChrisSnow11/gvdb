  "description": "Hey guys, it\u00b4s me, Jiri, writing again. I have been out of the game for a while. And I see that Honza didn\u00b4t even write anything about my little motorcycle-accident. Well, to make a long story short: My broken leg is almost working gain. And my dick is stronger than ever before - after pausing for a couple of weeks. So it was time to get my crutches and jump into the car. The streets have been save for straight guys long enough. My idea for the start was to get a guy into my car. I drove almost half an hour but no hitch-hiker nowhere. So I decided to ask some guys for the way pretending that my navigation wasn\u00b4t working. I offered them a few crowns and a lift for guiding me to the centre :-)",
