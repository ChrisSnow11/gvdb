  "description": "Gambling is the biggest problem in the Czech Republic. Ever younger people are falling victims to this terrible addiction. Our boy was one of the prime examples why it ruins lives. He started small, gambling away only tiny amounts on his mobile phone. Some time ago his mother gave him 40 000 to renovate his kitchen and he decided to risk and multiply his easily gained money. He just wanted more to buy new shiny things. After he lost everything on slot machines, he called me for help. The kitchen was renovated and the bill is getting overdue. His mother had no idea about the problems he got himself into. The boy was willing to do anything to hide his addiction from her. I\u00b4m quite sure he won\u00b4t touch a slot machine ever in his life.",
