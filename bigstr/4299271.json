  "description": "To celebrate the upcoming spring I have even a second catch for you today. Wenceslas square in Prague. At the beginning things went slow. For 20 minutes there was no one suitable passing by. Started to worry a bit. Within a while I was speaking to a young fella from Prague. But he was too shy to have any kind of fun. Second cutie, was from Opava, a city far, far away from Prague. I knew he will be easier. So after a usual chat, I did some research about how shy and experienced he is. He was not really shy and he was most importantly - money hungry. As soon as I got his price, I got this amazing idea to use just a cellar of one of the houses around, just to be a little bit adventurous. It was a perfect idea as you all are about to see.",
