  "description": "It is not so easy to get a loan in the Czech Republic these days. Especially not if you are young and don\u00b4t have a good job or no job at all. That\u00b4s why most guys who call me have lost their jobs recently. They want to keep their standard of living as long as they can while they are searching a new job. In this case a young man called me already three days before. I was quite busy but today I finally managed to visit him. Again a muscle boy but a nice one. He lived in that apartment together with his girlfriend. The place was clean and nicely-furnished. The funny thing was that his girlfriend didn\u00b4t even know that he lost his job. He was too shy to tell her. And he was even more shy when I told him my conditions.",
