  "description": "Sometimes I am really shocked when some young applicants tell me in how many positions they already worked before. And sometimes in totally different jobs. This one from today worked in various factories before. One has to get up early there - like around 5 am and the week is quite hard. Nothing for me to be honest but I respect people who are able to do those kind of jobs a lot. The salary wasn\u00b4t too bad in fact - around 20 000 CZK. But the main reason for him to look for something new wasn\u00b4t the money - but the chance to have more time for himself and his family. And he was happy when I told him about the vacancy. And about the salary as well. So he was willing to do something to get this job. He stripped a bit reluctantly. But how far would he go?",
