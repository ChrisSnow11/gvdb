  "description": "I always try to be on time. Still I was just a little late because the description the boy gave me was very confusing. That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t believe he was bitching about me being five minutes late! He had this smug and annoyed face when he asked where I had been. Arrogant bastard. Well, he wasn\u2019t so arrogant when we started talking about his financial problems. He didn\u2019t owe that much but he was jobless and single, so no income and no one to help him. I enjoyed the desperation in his eyes for a moment and then offered him my special offer. He was surprised and very much against any notion of gay sex. Which was a little weird, because he gave the best blowjob I had in weeks. Not to mention his tight and silk smooth virgin asshole.",
