  "description": "I love to completely derail other people\u00b4s plans. For example, this guy was going to have a job interview today. I bet he prepared for it, shaved himself, dressed nicely, maybe even put on some perfume. He was deep in his thoughts, probably rehearsing the right lines to impress his potential employer. And then I bumped into him and started talking to him. Very soon the job interview was forgotten. Because he was smart. There would always be other ordinary job opportunities. But ordinary jobs rarely make you 26 000 in one afternoon. He did the math and instead of trying to get a bartender job he ended up in my hotel room being pounded like if there was no tomorrow. He was straight but I\u00b4m sure he liked our little experiment. And if not, so what? I got what I wanted.",
