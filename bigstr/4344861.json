  "description": "Don\u00b4t get fooled by the shiny facade, Prague is going to hell and life here is getting more and more difficult. At least for ordinary people, life can be rough. This guy was a prime example. A nice good looking car mechanic and he couldn\u00b4t get a job! Can you believe it? Either the job market is on it\u00b4s last leg or the boy was just fucking lazy. He was definitely broke and sinking into debt. His flat was very nice so I was happy to hear that he didn\u00b4t pay the last rent. It\u00b4s always easier to convince people that are afraid of getting evicted. Nice flats are hard to come by in Prague. Our boy needed 20 000 and I offered him an elegant solution that would erase his debts. It was a little painful and humiliating for him but he managed to entertain me enough. It was money well spent.",
