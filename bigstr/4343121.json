  "description": "Everybody has a different motivation to apply for a new job. Someone might want a new challenge, someone wants to have more spare-time, someone is looking for a fulfillment and someone might just want to get more money. The guy who visited us today was just interested in a better payment. And I could understand him. In his last job he just made 14 000 CZK a month. It\u00b4s almost impossible to live from that small amount in a huge and rather expensive city like Prague. However, I was about to offer him a well-paid position as a truck-driver. A friend of mine had a vacancy and urgently needed someone. He had a driving license and even some experience in that field. He wanted the job. He needed money. So let the games begin.",
