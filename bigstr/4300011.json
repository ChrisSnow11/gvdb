  "description": "I had a bad feeling about this one from the beginning. The boy lived in a pretty nice flat and looked kind of arrogant. But his story made me hopeful. He took some loans to cover a flat deposit, he also wanted to make his girlfriend happy with a new phone. I just love After-Christmas-Season. And then he crashed his car. While the next month rent was looming on the horizon. 34 000 was the sum he needed and I was there for him. At first, he looked offended by my offer. Eventually the fear of disappointing his girlfriend changed his mind. Or of loosing the standard of living which she was used to. How could he tell her they\u00b4re going to leave their pretty apartment? It was such a pleasure to wipe that smug expression off his cute little face.",
