  "description": "My plan was to take my bike and go to the beach for a few hours. We have no access to the sea but a few nice beaches at the riverside. But as always I had my cam with me, prepared to go on the hunt. And then I saw him... a young guy, biker as well. I was so unprepared that I had problems finding the right words. I finally invited him out pretending that I wanted to speak about bikes. I love bikes - but I love boys more. I told him that my friend has a modeling company - and that he has potential. He was very interested and I had his attention. After a short fake call I told him that my friend has no time this week. I saw his disappointment. So this was my chance now - I showed him my money and told him that I have another nice offer for him.",
