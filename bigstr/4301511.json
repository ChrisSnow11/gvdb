  "description": "There aren\u00b4t that many people who would be able to work at a slaughter house. I\u00b4m certainly not one of them. That\u00b4s why I admired this young guy for working at such a place for two whole years. He was a bit mysterious and very reluctant to talk about his past. But he had some experience and education required for the job I had available. He tried to look cool. His smug face grew a bit uneasy when I told him about the 5 000 he would have to pay. He soon started asking question about alternatives. I told him there are none. \"I will do anything\" was his answer. I love that line. People usually don\u00b4t mean it. This one was hardcore, he meant every word. And I was more than happy to take advantage of his desperate financial situation.",
