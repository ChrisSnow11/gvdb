  "description": "I am still a bit slow after my motorcycle-accident. That\u00b4s why the public transport is one of the best spots for me to look for boys these days. Especially the metro. Boys are passing by and they usually have to wait for a while. On the other hand the people around get suspicious when they see a camera and hands full of money. So I always have to be a bit decent when approaching the guys. but then again the publicity makes me also feel a bit more safe. Otherwise I cannot explain myself why I approached such a muscular straight guy who had a rather aggressive appearance. I had to offer a lot of money to make him follow me to the hotel. Then suddenly he seemed to change his mind.",
