  "description": "It was a sunny afternoon when I went to the shopping-center in Prague-Andel. \"Andel\" means \"angel\" in Czech. And indeed I have seen more than one angel at this place. Today I met even two guys. Not exactly cute like angels. But at least one of them looked hot like hell. The guys came from Slovakia, our neighbouring country. They were looking for a job. And as far as they told me they must have been quite desperate. Still no job but almost broke. So they have been rather open to my little offers. The first thing I wanted them to do was to kiss each other. But not a short kiss... I insisted on a french one. In the middle of the crowd. And as they didn\u00b4t mind this I asked them for more.",
