  "description": "Today\u00b4s pick was a Slovakian guy. There is something about Slovaks what turns me on. Maybe it\u00b4s their accent or their looks. I don\u00b4t know, but I was looking forward to this meeting my whole day. I was surprised how great his apartment looked like. Clean, tidy and quite huge. Once we get to talk about his debt I was shocked. 50,000 CZK and trust me Gents, that\u00b4s a lot here in the Czech Republic. Reason why he owed so much was simple and stupid in the same time. He just wanted to live a standard he couldn\u00b4t afford. That\u00b4s why he called me, your friendly neighbor DEBTdandy. When I told him what\u00b4s my offer I could see his fear. I could smell it actually. And that\u00b4s a second turn on for me today. I knew I was going to fuck him really good.",
