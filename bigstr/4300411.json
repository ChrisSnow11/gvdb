  "description": "Our boy for today was very unlucky. He came to Prague by train where someone stole his luggage. He was very upset about it. He was kind of a redneck from a small village. He used to work as a maintenance guy of agricultural machinery and wanted to try something else. He wouldn\u00b4t be able to do that in Prague anyways. And he was outspending his income a lot because he was paying off a few motorbikes. Besides bikes, he had more interesting hobbies, martial arts are worth mentioning. I was curious about his body because he claimed to serve in the army. He was in shock when I offered him my usual deal but quickly agreed. He was totally broke. Coming from the countryside, he didn\u00b4t know how expensive Prague can be so he sold himself quite cheaply.",
