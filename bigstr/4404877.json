  "description": "My plan for today was to go hunting at a public swimming pool. I couldn't wait to have a look at some beefed-up dudes in trunks. Unfortunately, my phone died when I was in the middle of the drive. I decided to make the best of the bad situation and started hunting right there. It was a good move because I met a very cute young guy. He was a car mechanic and motorbike racer. The guy was pretty cool. He had his own race bike and no shortage of women. All he needed was money because racing was quite an expensive hobby. I had no problem with coughing up some green in exchange for a bit of naughty fun. The guy invited me to his flat nearby, where he took care of all my needs. I was really horny, and he was so sweet... I tried not to be rough, but you know how things sometimes go. Still, he enjoyed it a lot.",
