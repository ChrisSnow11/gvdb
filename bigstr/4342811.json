  "description": "Another young applicant today. He just turned 22 and graduated from logistics. Afterwards he worked as a driver. I didn't know that you have to graduate from logistics to work as a driver ;-) But the working-world can be strange nowadays. However, he looked somehow cute and even smart. His salary in that job was also not the best. Only 15 000 month. I expected it to be a bit higher from all what I know but why should he lie to me. On the other hand he was very excited about my offer. The interview was about a delivery-job and the salary was definitely above average. I could offer him 25 000 CZK. So he should be willing to give me something in return, shouldn't he? But instead he was about to leave me. But then he returned. Did he change his mind?",
