  "description": "A nice football fan came to my office all the way from Slovakia. He wanted to move from Bratislava to Prague. Our company has recently started a campaign inviting young people from Slovakia to seek new opportunities over here. It was a good idea. He came here full of optimism and he had enough experience to do quite well. He left his girlfriend in Bratislava with some debts he made. So he needed a good job to pay everything back and to convince his woman to come with him. No problem, as I always say: we offer only the best jobs. He looked very impressed by the position I had for him, too bad he couldn\u00b4t afford the fee. He had to find some other way to pay for the premium services our company provides. And the boy definitely tried the best he could.",
