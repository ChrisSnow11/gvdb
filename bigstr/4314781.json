  "description": "This boy had probably the messiest apartment I\u00b4ve ever been in. He moved to Prague three months ago and apparently didn\u00b4t settle in yet. On the other hand, he stopped paying rent so maybe he knew he might not be staying there for much longer. That\u00b4s why he called me for help. He needed 20 000 to pay his bills. He was definitely looking well enough for me to try my luck. You should have seen how angry he became! I almost started laughing but I didn\u00b4t want to blow this up. I knew there was still a chance to convince him. I had to calm him down and help him to see reason. He knew very well how much I could help him. He just had to play with my cock and endure a little bit of pain. He agreed and I couldn\u00b4t believe my eyes how the little bastard liked it!",
