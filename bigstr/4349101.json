  "description": "This was indeed a surprise. I didn\u00b4t expect today\u00b4s client to live in such a nice area - even in a house. I was bit skeptical if this guy would agree to my way of solving someones financial issues. Also I didn\u00b4t have so much cash on me that day as this guy sounded very young on the phone. Well, so I decided to listen to him and to sort out my chances - somehow it was a turn-on for me to fuck such a different \"type\" of client. Actually he lost his job 3 months ago. And the overdue mortgage summed up. Not a fortune to be honest. Despite my limited cashflow this day I would have been able to cover his small financial issue right away. But how would he react if I tell him my desires? His whole situation seemed not too bad... would he maybe get aggressiv?",
