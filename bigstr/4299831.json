  "description": "Today I went to a square with a nice Cathedral. I met two funny dudes there, one of them was kinda hot, if you like teenagers who look young. They had some potential so I took them to a nice pub but they didn\u00b4t want to do anything crazy. Still, it was a good idea to go there because at the next table I found my playthings for today: two adorable teenage boys. I just had to get rid off an annoying bitch that was sitting with them. When she was gone, I tried my money magic on them. These two friends weren\u00b4t easy to convince but when I got there, the reward was sweet. They pleased me in every possible way. And they weren\u00b4t afraid to have some fun with each other. I love  when I make friends bond together like this.",
