  "description": "It\u00b4s \"warehouse-day\" again. I will probably never understand why we have so many applicants for those jobs. On the other hand they don\u00b4t require too many qualifications. The guys applying are usually kinda handsome. Sometimes a bit older but still very nice. But the first guy was quite aggressive after I told him about my offer. He threatened to call the police - but there is nothing illegal about my proposal, so I didn\u00b4t get his point. The second one was probably too shy. I don\u00b4t know if he has something to hide in his pants. But still sad that he also didn\u00b4t agree. Finally a nice guy came in. Blond and desperately into this job. It took me a while to assure him that I am not faking and that he will really get the contract once he agrees to show me his body.",
