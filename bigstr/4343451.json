  "description": "It took me ages to go to my client today. Due to the horrible traffic jam I was about 2 hours late. On the other hand the guys want something from me - so I am quite sure that they would wait. And indeed the welcome was still more than friendly taking into account that I was his last hope for solving his financial problems. The client looked quite interesting for my taste. In his mid-twenties, glasses - he could actually work at a post office or at the nearby bank-branch. However, we went through all of his debts and I started to tell him that I am not exactly \"lending\" money. I am rather \"giving\" it: by the way I love the surprise in their eyes once I tell them this little fact. Well, what I wanted in return caused also a little surprise... but see by yourself.",
