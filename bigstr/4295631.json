  "description": "I wanted to enjoy Christmas spirit so I went for a nice evening walk. During the walk I went by a bar called \"Voodoo\". It piqued my interested so I wanted to see what made the bar so voodoo. Well, it was a normal bar and it was almost empty. I found three friends sitting at the table and waiting for their order. I invited them for a few games of table football. To make things interesting we bet a bit. Losers had to do various embarrassing things. My new friends were very cute so I started discussing more intimate subjects and proposing challenges involving nudity. Two of them were totally against it and eventually left. But the cutest one stayed because he needed money badly. The poor boy didn\u00b4t know what he signed up for. Trust me, this was the hardest money he had ever made.",
