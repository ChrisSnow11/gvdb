  "description": "I don\u2019t understand why some young people don\u2019t try harder. They pick an easy school and a brainless trade instead of something more ambitious. This guy studied to be a repairman of electric appliances. He hated the trade and ended up working at an assembly line where he put cars together. He could have been so much more. With his cute face and sharp mind he would be a perfect salesman or a manager for example. He definitely knew how to negotiate and bargain. I liked him a lot and he eventually took all the money I had. I didn\u2019t have much of a choice, he kept blabbing about what a terrible person I was so I had to shut his mouth with my money and then with my cock. He hated the \u201cinterview\u201d but my money was way too tempting for the boy.",
