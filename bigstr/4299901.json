  "description": "I got a call from a young businessman. Together with his colleagues, he decided to start his own firm. He expected to make big money so he was confident enough to take a consumer loan to furnish his new apartment. But the business did not go well. The result: debts. To make things even more interesting, the boy was not able to find a stable job. He made money here and there, barely getting by. I immediately noticed his muscular arms, he looked very well-built. When he told me about his construction worker part-time, I was not surprised. And he was a smart boy, too. It took him only a minute to say yes to my irresistible offer. I like dealing with reasonable men who know what is best for them.",
