  "description": "Because of my job I already became used to dirty places. I don\u00b4t know why but I think once people get too desperate they seem to even forget about the place where they are living. The guy who called me today seemed to be really messy. He lived in a village 75 km from Prague. When I came in I really had problems to find a place to sit. The guy himself was actually quite handsome though he was dressed like... well... you can see the pictures. When we had counted all numbers his situation didn\u00b4t even seem so desperate. The amount was not unusually high. But when you don\u00b4t have a job even smaller debts can fuck your brain. And not only your brain. Do you know what I mean?",
