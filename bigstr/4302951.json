  "description": "This sweet boy had just turned 18. The day before he threw a wild birthday party. Apparently he had a great fun and so did his guests. He woke up with headache and started cleaning up the apartment. At some point he realized that all his money was gone. One of his friends stole it! Our boy got 25 000 from his grandmother to buy his first car. She saved the money for some time and was looking forward too see her grandson happy. The boy had already ordered a car and paid an advance. He was supposed to pick the car up and drive to his grandmother to show it to her. He was very sad. I knew exactly how to solve his problem. He just had to entertain me a little. The boy felt so guilty about loosing the grandma\u00b4s money that he agreed.",
