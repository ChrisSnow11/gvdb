  "description": "This boy looked totally oblivious of the mess he got himself into. He got fired because of absences. He wanted a day-off so he simply didn\u00b4t show up. This young generation has no work discipline. Before he got fired, he wanted to start living on his own. He wanted to show his parents that he can take care of himself. He moved into an empty flat and started refurnishing. It didn\u00b4t take long before he ran out of money, of course. He took a consumer loan to finish what he started. After loosing his job, all his plans fell apart. But he was too proud to ask the parents for help, honorable but stupid. Or maybe his situation wasn\u00b4t that desperate yet. I liked his boyish charm very much so I was willing to help. For young and spoiled guys, life is the best teacher.",
