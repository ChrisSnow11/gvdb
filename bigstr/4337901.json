  "description": "The first guy who come in today was rather an IT guy. He looked quite well but I already had the feeling that he wasn\u00b4t the right one for this position. And indeed he rejected my offer and called it even unserious. However, the second guy was even more suitable. Both for the job and also from his appearance. A friend of mine has a casino-ship and was looking for a croupier. An unusual position and quite hard to find an appropriate candidate. So he asked me for help... why not. Back to that second guy. He worked in a casino before. He also didn\u00b4t take me serious when I asked him to strip naked. But when I assured him that he will really get the job he finally agreed. And as I found out he needed money. So I offered him a bonus for a fuck.",
