  "description": "It was too damn hot in the city centre, so I decided to look for boys at the outskirts. I needed some outdoor action today. The town quarter I went to was cooler but almost empty. Not even a nice pub anywhere around. After long minutes of searching I bumped into Michal, a 25 years old construction worker. He was in this part of Prague because of work. There was a problem with his employer, he owed Michal a lot of money for previous work. So our boy told him that he\u00b4s not gonna work until he gets paid. He was just perfect. Young and angry boy who really needed money. I was lucky his boss was such a greedy jerk, otherwise he wouldn\u00b4t have done all the nice stuff I like. We left the road and wandered into the forest. I had plenty of time to enjoy Michal\u00b4s ripped and lean body",
