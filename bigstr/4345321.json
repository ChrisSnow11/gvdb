  "description": "It was a rainy late afternoon when I had a meeting with a young man who apparently was in financial needs. So far nothing new. But usually people don\u00b4t let me wait. And actually I was almost about to leave again when he finally showed up. He was just shopping for a soft drink as he just came back from work. And indeed he has been wearing rather nice clothes. Well, the trousers have seen better days already... but a very nice shirt. Anyway. He told me that he works for an insurance company and somehow he has to pay back provisions as many customers cancelled their contracts recently. Then there was a private loan and so on. Not a huge sum but all had to be paid soon. Hmmm... would he agree to my special offer?",
