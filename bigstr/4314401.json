  "description": "Ales looked like someone who used to be a nerd for the most of his life. Then something changed and he rebelled against the world. He dropped out of school, knocked up some girl back in his home town, and covered himself with tattoos. He still looked quite cute and intelligent but you could tell he wanted to be a rebel. He moved to Prague to start a new life but so far he was failing miserably. 28 000 Crowns was the sum that would get him out of financial trouble. He didn\u00b4t have a job worth mentioning so I wasn\u00b4t ready to lend him anything, instead I offered him a fun way out of his problems. He had to follow my naughty orders to earn the money. The boy agreed and trust me, watching his innocent face contorted with pain and pleasure was incredibly hot!",
