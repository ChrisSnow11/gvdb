  "description": "It was a late Thursday night and I was bored. I switched on my computer and browsed through my favorite emails from my beloved Dudes in debts. The only thing is that I never know who I pick, they just send a text email, mostly without a pic of face or whatever. But well, the vision of late night entertainment was as always stronger. So I\u00b4ve suited up and went to meet my next indebted little victim. Young, kinda good-looking with well built body. Hmmm, this is going to be fun, I\u00b4ve thought. I was amazed what a nice apartment he had and still he was in bloody debts. C\u00b4mon! After the usual sum up, I\u00b4ve proposed what I want from him in return. And to my surprise, he actually laughed.Well nice and approachable personality he had.",
