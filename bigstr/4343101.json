  "description": "When I met Jarda, he was standing in the street and eating kebab. I couldn\u00b4t think of any conversation opener so I just asked about his stupid kebab. I wanted to see the place where he bought it and he agreed to lead me there. He was an interesting young guy obsessed with tattoos. And he was covered with them. Jarda dreamed of becoming a tattoo artist but lacked the necessary skills and above all he lacked money. I couldn\u00b4t teach him how to draw but I certainly could improve his budget. We fooled around in the streets for some time and then moved to his apartment to talk about the real stuff. He agreed to do all sorts of things and was pretty good for a newbie. Then came the moment when he was about to loose his ass virginity.",
