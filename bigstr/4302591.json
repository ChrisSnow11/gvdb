  "description": "I noticed this boy already half an hour before. He was standing there alone and seemed to wait for somebody. When I finally decided to approach him I realized that the access to a path leading up the hill was blocked. And he was just there to inform the people about it as this park is quite popular for skiing and sledding. Yes, that might sound strange for a few of my Western friends but this is some sort of a relict from the communist times. However, he was not really talkative although I though he should be happy that somebody offered a conversation. Must be really boring to stand there the whole day for about 500 crowns. So I offered him money for a small favor. It really took a whole while to convince him.",
