  "description": "I wanted to breathe some fresh air today, to enjoy sunny spring weather. Well, this idea didn\u00b4t turned out particularly great. The weather was quite chilly, the park I chose for a walk was a little depressing. To make things even better, I got a bit lost. I didn\u00b4t want to backtrack so I kept going, hoping for a nice catch. After good ten minutes I met a young guy headed home from school. He was pretty cool and talkative, he even offered me to lead me to a nearby bus station. The boy was almost eager to be on camera. He even told me some pretty juicy stuff. Being a working student, his life wasn\u00b4t easy. Still he tried to enjoy every moment of it. I offered him a nice and easy way to make money. Our guy didn\u00b4t mind extra cash at all. He only had to fulfill my every wish.",
