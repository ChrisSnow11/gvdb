  "description": "I was feeling lazy today, so I\u00b4ve decided to go for a sure thing. A train station is always the best pick-up place. Just after few minutes I\u00b4ve got what I wanted. Bit confused, young looking traveller who didn\u00b4t have an idea where to go. Once again I\u00b4ve used my \" ...it\u00b4s a school project... \" pickup line. We sat down at a small canteen, ordered baked tea and some crepes and started to talk. It was his first time in Prague and he came alone. This just made him the easiest game I\u00b4ve ever hunt down. After a small talk I\u00b4ve shown him the money. That amazed him and he wasn\u00b4t scared anymore. I saw the GREEN in his eyes and I knew that the greed will make him agree to do things he never even thought of.",
