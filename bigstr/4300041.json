  "description": "This guy had to be a terrible employee. He was a graphic and web designer. Come on, don\u00b4t tell me it\u00b4s that hard to find a job in the field. Internet is booming. I bet he was just lazy, going through Facebook all day instead of working. Or maybe the reason was his laughable idea that he deserved 50 000 a month. Stop dreaming, boy, this is real life. I offered him a decent IT job for 33 000. He liked it. But how should we deal with the fee? He looked very nicely shaped under his hoodie so it was obvious what I was gonna go after. He was extremely easy to convince to drop his pants. It was almost shocking. I noticed a little scratch. Apparently the boy\u00b4s friend tried to tear his underpants off him during a birthday party. Last night. I knew this guy is going to be fun.",
