  "description": "I couldn't pick a worse time, and place to go hunting. I travelled to a small town not far from Prague but the weather turned against me before I got there. The place was absolutely deserted and de-pressing. I put the camera on to make some footage. To my surprise, I noticed a tall and good-looking guy coming my way. I approached him and it turned out he was in the mood for a little talk. He came to Prague from Slovakia to look for jobs and one of the interviews took place at this small town. He was tired of looking for work and wanted to have fun tonight. Not the sort of fun I was looking for but we managed to make a deal. I was the one who would get entertained first and then he could have fun with my money. He was pretty easy to convince, I simply paid to get what I want.",
