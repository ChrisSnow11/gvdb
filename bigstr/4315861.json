  "description": "Today I had a vacancy for a job assistant. For those of you who don't believe - those jobs are real. It\u2019s all about networking and I have about 200 friends and acquaintances who have small or bigger businesses and are gay. And for them it is a turn-on if I \u201etest\u201c their future employers not only for their CV and abilities but also for their willingness to \u201edo whatever it takes\u201c. Anyway, the guy entering my office in the early afternoon just lost his job. I was wondering why and I can be persistent to find out. He basically had a few problems with colleagues. He even mentioned a fight. That was something unexpected for me as he appeared here in a suit and looked fully trustworthy. But I decided to give him a chance and check him out. I wanted to start with his body\u2026",
