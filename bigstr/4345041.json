  "description": "This guy\u2019s life wasn\u2019t exactly a success story. He graduated from high school three years ago but never had a single full-time job. He moved to Prague and worked part-times here and there, which wasn\u2019t enough to pay his bills. His only achievement was his rather rich girlfriend. Too bad that her parents saw him as a deadbeat loser not good enough for their daughter. Well, she loved him but he couldn\u2019t live with her. At least for now. That was why his bills started to pile and he needed my help. On top of everything, his girlfriend planned a vacation for them and he had to pay his share. The guy needed 20 000. That was cool, he was definitely worth the money. The boy was young and nicely shaped, I\u2019m sure he was great in bed. I just had to convince him to take the money\u2026",
