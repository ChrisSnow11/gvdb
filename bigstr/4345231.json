  "description": "This young man was living in Prague for three years. He moved here because of a job. It was well-paid so he decided to take a mortgage and buy a big flat. The boy got a good deal but he was totally depending on his salary and stretching his budget. After three years, he got fired and problems started to pile up. The boy was pretty competent so he got a new job fast but not fast enough. Mortgage and some unexpected expenses couldn\u2019t wait, he needed 18 000 Crowns. I was feeling unusually horny today so I was willing to do anything to help the boy. Too bad he didn\u2019t like my way of helping. But the terms of the loan were too harsh so he started to think again. He kneeled down and gave one of the best blowjobs I\u2019ve ever had.",
