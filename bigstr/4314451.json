  "description": "When somebody calls our number they are usually shy and nervous because they have debts. This boy was different. He called us, he told us about a nice amount and he was even smiling on the phone. That indeed was a challenge for The General.  When he visited him he had problems to even find the place. It was not a flat nor anything like an apartment. He lived in some sort of a shop in a dirty and old shopping-centre. But instead of being happy that somebody came to help him he even refused to let our General inside. All because of the camcorder. Well I guess it was again my mistake as I didn\u2018t explain it before. And when he finally let him in it was quite difficult to explain him or offer.",
