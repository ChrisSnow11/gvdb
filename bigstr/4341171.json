  "description": "Reckless driving is a very stupid thing, you can even serve some time if caught. This guy didn\u00b4t get caught but something even worse happened to him. He and his friend crashed into a very expensive car that was driven by an angry Russian guy accompanied by his friends. The deal was as follows: no police, 50 000 from each as compensation. The insurance company wouldn\u00b4t pay anything to a bad driver so the poor lad had to scrape every single Crown he had. And still he was 22 000 short. Apparently, the Russian was not a guy you would like to mess with. And definitely not to owe him money. The boy was scared, which made things very easy, indeed. I knew he will do anything to solve the problem. We even had time to try his girlfriend\u00b4s vibrators :-)",
