  "description": "I don\u00b4t often meet rich spoiled dudes. This guy was something special. He was no genius but at least he knew how to party. His parents left him home and went on a vacation. So he decided to go totally crazy. He spent all his money on parties, and gambling. When he run out of money, he borrowed more and partied like there was no tomorrow. Well, the tomorrow did come and his parents were soon to follow. He started panicking, he was afraid they might kick him out for his behavior. So he called me. I guess he wanted to delay the moment by a few weeks, maybe even hoped to get money to solve the problem. I offered him the best possible solution ever. He wasn\u00b4t happy but eventually he did everything I wanted.",
