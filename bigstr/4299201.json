  "description": "I saw this one buying ice cream and I instantly knew he was going to be perfect. He was in a hurry to a gym. Which was a bit annoying because I had to follow him around for a while. It took a lot of effort to convince this young Ukrainian cutie to finally stop for a minute. How did I managed that? By using money, of course. He was really agile and open-minded. He even agreed to take a shower under a small waterfall. I know, from personal experience, that water in the pool is pretty cold. Thank god, we had a nice summer day, maybe the boy even liked cooling down a bit. At that point I could see the boy was hooked, he was after my money. We found a discreet place near the path and started. Then I found out I forgot my lube at home. The poor boy didn\u00b4t have a lucky day.",
