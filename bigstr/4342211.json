  "description": "Computer guys are great. They may be talented in one particular area but they often lack in others. This boy was a real technology enthusiast, he loved all kinds of gadgets. But he was terrible at money management and a little bit delusional about his importance. He wanted a bigger flat and he decided to get the money he needed by borrowing from me. He told me that he would get a nice programmer job very soon. He was sure about it. I\u00b4ve seen overconfident guys like him before. I would never lend him anything. But I would certainly pay him for a little bit of fun. He was 18 years old innocent looking boy. Not to mention he was extremely shy. All that created a perfect combination. He was incredibly cute when I shoved my cock down his throat.",
