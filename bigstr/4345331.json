  "description": "Today I picked Ziskov, a very dirty and dodgy part of Prague. Straight after my today\u00b4s boy opened the door, I knew I am at Ziskov. Wearing horrible, purple, 70\u00b4s like shirt. He looked like a cheap version of John Travolta from Saturday night fever. But anyway I knew I am gonna enjoy popping his tight ass deeply in debts.  As I sat down, the chair broke and that pissed me off. While we summed up his debts, the anger in me grown so much that I almost couldn\u00b4t wait to punish him for his stupidity, irresponsibility and red-neck\u00b4s look. One thing I hate most is a mess. And of course he was a messy little f*cker. I made him to clean the dishes first and then we moved to something what was try to look like a bedroom. No bed just mattress.",
