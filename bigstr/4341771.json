  "description": "This boy wanted to live a rich man\u2019s life. He moved to the outskirts of Prague into a pretty nice neighborhood. And his house was even bigger than mine! The boy was lucky that he had rich parents. He used to work as a shop assistant in his home town but his father wasn\u2019t happy about it. He called a few people and got his underachieving son a much better job in Prague. On top of that, he decided to pay his rent for one year. Well, that\u2019s why the boy could afford such a nice place. But the easy times were coming to an end. His daddy was strict. As the year passed, no more money was send. The boy was on his own, burdened by the debts he made. He didn\u2019t need too much money though, which made him difficult to convince. But he was so young and cute\u2026 I had to try.",
