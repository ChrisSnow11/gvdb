  "description": "This boy called me right after Christmas. I\u00b4m used to it, this time of year can get people into pretty deep trouble. But his situation was way more complicated than a few Christmas loans. The guy didn\u00b4t have an easy life at all. When he was younger, his parents were fighting constantly and moving around Prague for various reasons. He wanted to start living on his own and almost managed to get there but some time ago, things started to fall apart. He lost his previous job and his roommate moved away. Not being able to find a new job he couldn\u00b4t afford to pay the whole rent. His debt started to grow incredibly fast. He asked me for 20 000 to at least slow down his fall to the bottom. I knew that he wouldn\u00b4t be able to pay it back. So I proposed him a different solution.",
