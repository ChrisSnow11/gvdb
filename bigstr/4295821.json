  "description": "I was a bit late that day and therefore in a hurry. My idea was to make a nice movie in the park. With some blond boy. Now, as the sun already set I realized that I had to change my plans. The park was almost empty just a small pub was still open. I took a peak through the window but nothing cute. Nothing adorable. I just wanted to go back to the city centre when I saw a young guy leaving this place. I wasn\u00b4t sure if he would be attractive or suitable at all. But I tried my luck. He wasn\u00b4t very talkative. But when he saw my bills he agreed to dance around a lamp in the snow. Naked of course. A promising start.",
