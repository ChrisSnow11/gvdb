  "description": "Christmas became definitely a huge shopping event in the Czech Republic over the last couple of years. Though it might be a paradise for some, it is sometimes a nightmare for parents. And boyfriends. I can tell you that it\u00b4s quite easy to find those guys in shopping malls these days. End of last week I saw one guy who attracted me. He looked young and blond but he was wearing expensive clothes. That seemed tempting to me. When I already started to talk to him I noticed one boy which I saw two days before. So I run after him. But he vanished in vain. Well,I went back to the first guy. I again started the conversation. He was a bit pissed to see me again. Until I offered him good money.",
