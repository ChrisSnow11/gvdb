  "description": "This poor guy wanted to be a cook but his school counselor recommended him to try a job that would require less attention. So he became a candy maker. How that job requires less attention than a cook I had no idea and the boy didn\u00b4t exactly help me to understand. Anyways, he spent only three months at a sweets factory and then got fired. At the moment he was employed as an ordinary factory worker. He hated the job and wanted change. I didn\u00b4t have any job related to candy so at least I offered him something that was better paid than his current job. But first, he had to take care of my hard piece of candy that was growing in my pants from the start of the interview. I was in a kinky mood today so we fooled around a little. Then I filled him with my sweet custard.",
