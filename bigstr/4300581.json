  "description": "Today\u00b4s mission took me to the outskirts of Prague. After almost one hour drive I finally reached an area where obviously no-one really would want to live. Large communist buildings; each of them built for hundreds of families. Even the doorbell wasn\u00b4t working. So I had to wait a couple of minutes until today\u00b4s \"client\" showed up to open me the door. His apartment was basically a small room as he shared the flat with 2 mates to share the costs. And as he moved in just recently he didn\u00b4t even have a bed. Instead he had a lot of debts. Not actually that much -but some of them were private-debts which were already overdue. He was a straight guy in his mid-twenties working in a tattoo-studio. A real challenge to get my \"client\u00b4s\" ass this time.",
