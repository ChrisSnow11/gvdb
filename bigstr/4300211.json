  "description": "Czech boys are sometimes incredibly careless. This guy got a customer loan approved, went to a bank, withdrew 20 000 Crowns, and after all that trouble he lost it on the way home! He put the money in an envelope and apparently it slipped out of his pocket. I\u00b4m serious. He had a little daughter with his girlfriend and their plan was to furnish a room for her. That\u00b4s what the money was for. So there he was, sitting in front of me, sad and desperate. Obviously, his girlfriend would probably leave him if she knew. That\u00b4s why he tried to hide it from her and use my money to pay for the furniture. I already had one \"meeting\" today but the boy was so good looking I was willing to give him all the money I had left. I couldn\u00b4t ruin their Christmas, could I?",
