  "description": "This guy used to have a terribly lazy girlfriend. He had to work while she just sit on her ass at home. Too bad that the flat they were living in was her grandmother\u2019s so when they broke up, our guy had to move away. He was so angry about the whole situation that he decided to go to Prague and buy his own apartment. I thought that was maybe too ambitious but I said nothing. The boy needed 20 000 Crowns from me to get rid of a debt. Unless the debt was paid, his bank wouldn\u2019t give him a mortgage. He was staying at his friend\u2019s at the time and wanted to get out of the place as soon as possible. Why wouldn\u2019t I help such a cute boy? He was only 21 years old, nicely tattooed, and pretty muscular. Of course, I gave him the money he needed.",
