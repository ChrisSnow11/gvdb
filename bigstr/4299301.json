  "description": "Walking around a shopping centre I met Lukas. His car battery died and he had to replace it. He was fresh out of driving school so he was quite unsure about what to do. I\u00b4m far from being a car mechanic but I definitely had more experience than this handsome boy. I offered him my help and together we managed to repair his car. Lukas was very upset by the unexpected expenses caused by the unfortunate situation. He was very attractive so I wanted to help him a little. He looked surprised by my offers. But at the same time he actually looked flattered. He even kept asking me if I found him attractive! What a cute boy. I brought along a lot of money today so I didn\u00b4t have to hold back. It was relatively easy to convince him to have some fun on the back seats of his car.",
