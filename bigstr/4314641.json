  "description": "I love lending money to college students. They are usually smart and absolutely skint, which is sexy and useful. This guy was no exception. He shared a pretty big house with two other classmates but somehow forgot to pay his share of the rent. He was three months behind and the owner was about to kick him out. I don\u00b4t think he realized how severe the situation actually was. Well, lending him money would be a waste of my time. The boy could never meet our terms. My alternative and a lot naughtier offer surprised him only a little. Maybe because he was offered to have gay sex for money before. He turned it down back then. This time, things were different. His muscular body and huge boner made me so excited! I squeezed all cum out of the guy.",
