  "description": "Perfect weather for the outdoor-pools in Prague. We really have a lot of them. But as it was over-crowded I was too shy to hunt inside so I decided to start my hunt this time just in front of the main-gate. As it was already late afternoon dozens of cute, young guys were leaving the place. First I met a student of Architecture. He was quite shy although I only wanted to see him in his swim-wear. So again strategy-change. This time I wanted to offer more cash but I also wanted to see more. The next guy was again a student. He attended a law-school. I was worried that he would refuse because this might endanger his career. But as his only income was from a shitty job in a warhorse he was more open than excepted towards my offer. Bingo.",
