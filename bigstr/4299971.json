  "description": "I don\u00b4t consider myself to be a money lender. To be honest, I despise loan-sharks. They are scum who destroy people\u00b4s lives. The boy who asked me for help was a prime example. He tried to solve his situation by borrowing money from such a shady character. This cute aspiring guitar player borrowed 3 000 Crowns. When the debt was due, he was supposed to pay 9 000 or loose a tooth or two. He also owed 14 000 for his car. Fortunately, his girlfriend, unaware of all this, was somewhere else so I could try my best to safe the boy. He wasn\u00b4t very impressed by my special offer. Sitting on his comfy couch in his nice little apartment, he eventually realized how much he could loose. And I did my good deed for the week. It didn\u00b4t even hurt. Well, at least not me.",
