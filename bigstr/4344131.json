  "description": "Students don\u00b4t have an easy life. This young guy studied to be a male nurse. I thought it was a bit weird career choice for a boy but whatever. As he said, college isn\u00b4t cheap so he spent a lot of money to become a proper hipster student. He bought a laptop, some fancy textbooks and spent the rest on parties. But the debt caught up with him. He had two days to get 25 000. An impossible task with his supermarket part-time job. So he came to a professional. And I was more than happy to help him. 21 years old students are always worth the money. It took him some time to decide but eventually he agreed to my nasty terms. I bet he does some pretty freaky stuff with his girlfriend when no one else is looking. I picked the right guy to help to.",
