  "description": "This boy told me he\u00b4s not good with money. He started renovating his entire flat, apparently his girlfriend pushed him into it. He saved and borrowed a lot of money but it still wasn\u00b4t enough. Then he took a big portion of the money and had a pretty wild night out with his friends. Wasting 20 000 in one night is not difficult in Prague. He needed 40 000 to pay the workers and I was supposed to help him. He hired Ukrainians to do the job. They\u00b4re cheap but it\u00b4s not a good idea to make them angry. You never know who they might work for. So here I was, helping another foolish boy out of the mess he got himself into. I hesitated for a moment because 40 000 is a lot and the flat was a bit disgusting. But the boy was very good. He really tried to earn every single coin.",
