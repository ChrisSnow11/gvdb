  "description": "Another boy smashed his car. This time it wasn\u00b4t because of bad weather. The young gentlemen was simply too gone. He was scared he might get arrested so he drove away from the crash. The car was toasted but he took it to a repair shop anyways. Too bad for him that he was broke. He wanted 35 000 from me. He needed the car to drive himself and his girlfriend to work. She would freak out without the car. She wouldn\u00b4t go to work by a bus! Women! The girlfriend was on a spa vacation with her mother and both were coming home very soon. The boy was desperate. I almost started laughing when I imagined both ladies yelling at the poor guy. I couldn\u00b4t wish for better circumstances. He was mine for taking.",
