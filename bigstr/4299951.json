  "description": "This guy was another case of poor judgement. He got threatened by his landlord to pay 8 000 for rent he owed. To solve the problem, the boy went to a loan-shark for a quick loan. Which ended as usual. When I got there, the loan shark wanted 15 000 back and already started to show teeth. This business practice is very common in the Czech Republic. The boy was very lucky I was not interested in his money. I wanted something much more precious to me: his virginity. He wanted to get rid off all his debts so he and his girlfriend could breathe easily. I was one hundred percent sure he didn\u00b4t have any gay inclinations, which was why my offer got him really scared. They are always scared, at first. Then they start thinking and I know I will get what I want.",
