  "description": "It\u00b4s not easy to get rid of your past. When you commit a crime, it is going to stick to you. This boy used to steal to fill his empty wallet. Eventually, he got caught. His family renounced him because of it, his friends stopped trusting him. It\u00b4s almost impossible to start living an honest life again. But the boy did fine, for a while. He was really into music, he even tried to build some sort of a sound studio in his living room. Buying all the equipment and paying over time looked like a good idea. Until he lost the job. When he called me, his debts were unusually high. His criminal past caught up with him: no one was eager to lend money to a former criminal. I could tell the boy was in need. He was very nervous but I was sure to get what I came for.",
