  "description": "An IT guy fresh out of school came to my office today. He was so scared it was cute. I even had to calm him down. This was his first job interview ever. He wanted to be a manager but had no skills for such a job. In my opinion, he wasn\u00b4t cut out for that a position at all. He was a typical shy IT guy. That\u00b4s why I offered him an IT position in which he would make nice money. The boy only had to pay our mediation fee. He wasn\u00b4t happy about it so I offered him an alternative. He claimed to be a football player so I wanted to see his nice and lean body. He wasn\u00b4t exactly ripped but if you like young and small guys, you will enjoy this episode a lot. I certainly enjoyed our little interview. He was so good that I told him to call me again if he needed a job.",
