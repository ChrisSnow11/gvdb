  "description": "It was one of those cold winter days which I really hate. A mix of snow and rain and cold wind ruined my mood. I was on my way to a guy who has sent me an email already one week before. When I checked my spam folder yesterday I finally noticed it. So I called him back. He obviously didn\u2018t expect any reaction anymore. I told him that I have to record our conversation but he looked still a bit pissed when he saw my cam. Anyway - he lived in an old, dirty house. But still his room was clean and nice. He told me about his debts. But although I saw a picture with him and his girl friend on the table I somehow felt that this boy was strange. Was he gay or bi-curious? I offered my help to find it out.",
