  "description": "I recently told a close friend of mine about our new agency. He asked me if I didn\u2018t have a bad conscience taking advantage of poor straight boys and their debts. I told him not at all. Because after all we help them. I consider that as a great offer unless you consider sex itself as something sinful. Then he shut up. Why am I telling this? Because I got a call today and I visited a client in some barrack which he called a house. In fact he was renovating it together with his girlfriend. And they put all their money into it. Now he lost his job. And if nobody would help him he would have to sell his small dream for a few bucks. Of course I wanted something in return. But after all I was the one who offered help.",
