  "description": "This man travelled to my office from a small town a dozen kilometers away from Prague. I was a little worried about him because he got expelled from school due to bullying. He managed to explain the reasons why it happened, but I was still unsure what to think about him. He finished the next school he attended as a chef so I offered him a kitchen position at a hotel. He liked the job even though he didn't look very enthusiastic about it. That made me worried a little, as I was getting quite horny, and impatient. The guy wasn't thrilled about our mediation fee, and even less about the naughty option I gave him to take care of it. He had a girlfriend so his reservations were understandable. However, I wanted to have fun, I had to make the move. In the end, it took all my money to convince him.",
