  "description": "It was a terrible rainy day and I was stupid enough to hunt at a park near Vltava river. The place was obviously totally deserted and I was getting soaking wet. When I was about to give up, I saw this boy leaving one of the docked boats at the river bank. He was nice enough to talk to me and later even showed me some skin. It cost me some money but the boy was adorable. He had a lean and firm body of a young man. I would fuck him right there but the rain was quite annoying. And I had to convince the boy first, of course. He had no experience but he admitted being a bit bicurious as a teenager. Also he was incredibly greedy, which wasn\u00b4t too surprising. You have to pay extra to get the good stuff. I rented us a cabin we could hide from the rain. Anchors away!",
