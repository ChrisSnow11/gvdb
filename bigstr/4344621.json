  "description": "\"Kevin alone at home\" - I don\u00b4t know why but I had to think about that movie the whole time when I visited my last client. But I better start right from the beginning. I got a call this afternoon. On the other end of the line was a guy with a quite young voice. He told me that he desperately needs money. So I offered him a meeting in the evening. He told me he needs it now- later it wouldn\u00b4t help anymore. Ok... our slogan is to \"help young men\". So I agreed and visited him right after the call. He obviously lived in his parent\u00b4s home. They were somehow on holidays but supposed to come back that very evening. As he didn\u00b4t want to tell me who he was owing the money to I guess he stole it from his parents.",
