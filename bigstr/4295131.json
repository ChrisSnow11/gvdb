  "description": "It was one of those last late-summer days which made me visit one of my favorite spots. This small park is almost famous amongst gays for all the cyclists and skaters practicing there. But although the weather was nice (it was really hot) the spot was far too quite this day. After a whole while I noticed a guy with inline-skates who looked quite sportive. But as he was wearing sun-glasses I had to check his face first. So I stopped and talked him into a small chat. He was going to study law. Amazing. And though he was dreaming about the big money he was at the same time looking for a part-time job. The perfect mix I thought not yet knowing how expensive this day might get.",
