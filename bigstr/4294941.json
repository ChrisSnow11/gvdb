  "description": "This was a strange experience for me. I was searching the streets of Prague - nothing special about that so far - when I noticed this young guy who appeared a bit lost. He was from Slovakia and he had obvious some problems to find his hotel. Apart from that he appeared to have no financial problems. He was in Prague for holidays even. And what was so strange? Well, we know that about 8-10% of the male adult population are gay. It is obvious that sometimes I meet somebody gay who even enjoys my \"dirty offer\". But this one was definitely not gay. And he was not in need of money. And still he did agree. I still try to figure out what his motivation was.",
