  "description": "Today I had an interesting call. An apparently young guy was on the phone telling me that he had problems with a bank and a phone company. So far nothing new. But he wasn\u00b4t as obedient as clients usually are on the phone. So I decided to check him out. He was living quite far from my office and when I arrived I realized that he was kinda handsome. It was one of those buildings where I already hate to enter the elevator. All old communist style and interior. Anyway - he was living together with a roommate who lucky left right after I came. His debt summed up to just 25.000 CZK. Not such a big deal. So I made my offer for cash in exchange for sex. And... he didn\u00b4t appear to be even shocked... like most of the other guys are.",
