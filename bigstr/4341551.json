  "description": "Karel and Klaudie, two friends who just wanted to have a nice evening. I met them on their way to a local Sea world. We started chatting and because I knew the place I offered them to buy the tickets for all of us. In return they had to let me join them. We had a nice talk about various topics, most importantly about the length of Karel\u2019s private parts. According to Klaudie they were \u201cimpressive\u201d. I was very interested so I talked him into showing some skin right there. It was cool. Now I just had to convince Karel to stop being so scared. After all, I was just a nice guy with a camera and money in my pockets. And he wanted it badly. Unemployed students with debts usually do. I took him to my hotel room where we spent a very nice evening together.",
