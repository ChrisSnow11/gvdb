  "description": "These kind of stories happen only in real life. The young man started a business in repairing musical instruments. He got his first orders. Everything looked promising until he dropped and wrecked the very instruments he was supposed to repair. He tried to do his best to fix them but it proved to be beyond his skills. Desperate, he asked another craftsman to do it for him. The bill: 29 000. I liked his resolve and optimism so I offered him my help. He really wanted to make this business work so he agreed. You just don\u00b4t turn down a second chance like that. Even though he was a bit scared and quite inexperienced I enjoyed his mouth and ass very much. It\u00b4s always such a pleasure to help others.",
