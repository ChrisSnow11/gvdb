  "description": "When I have meetings with my clients, I usually try to leave their girlfriends out of it. This episode is a prime example why. The young couple called me to solve their financial problem. They were supposed to go on holidays very soon but the boy spent most of their money. They needed 25 000 very quickly. The girl was extremely upset about the whole situation while he was trying to look cool and relaxed. They argued a lot, not making my work any easier. I had to get rid off her so I simply told them that I wanted to fuck and I didn\u00b4t care which ass was it gonna be. She went apeshit and told her boyfriend to fix the situation. And then she left! What a bitch. At least I had the young man for myself now. His body was superb and he tried very hard to fix the problem.",
