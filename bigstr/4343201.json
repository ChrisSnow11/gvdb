  "description": "I scheduled a job-interview for a waiter this day. A huge new complex including a hotel and a restaurant with a bar was about to open soon in the outskirts of Prague. My applicant appeared in a white shirt and he looked serious and interested. Right now he was unemployed but he worked as a waiter before in several restaurants here in Prague. Amongst them were at least two which are quite famous. The reason why he quit there was basically the under-average payment and the unfair charing of the tips. My offer was much better payed so I was sure I would get his attention. As asked him about his hobbies I found out that he was quite sportive. A good starter for me to go on and tell him about the veil fee we have. Or to let him show me his sportive chest instead.",
