  "description": "This boy lived in a terrible apartment. It wasn\u00b4t run-down and just plain ugly. He tried to renovate the place a bit but it didn\u00b4t help much. The flat still looked like something from the 70s. The Eastern bloc 70s. In the middle of the renovation our boy lost his job. He had no savings, no unemployment benefits... The bills were getting due soon so he needed someone who would lend him money and didn\u00b4t check his credit rating. I didn\u00b4t care about his financial situation as long as I got what I wanted. I didn\u00b4t expect him to pay me back. I was super horny today so I was willing to pay for his ugly renovation. The boy was a bit scared and in shock at first. Soon the pain in his tight virgin ass cleared his mind. I hope he enjoyed our lovely afternoon together. But who knows...",
