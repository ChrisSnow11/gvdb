  "description": "These two dudes got seriously behind with paying the rent. At first, I thought they were a gay couple but apparently they were just good friends. The dumber of them got into an argument with his girlfriend and to calm his nerves he lost 28 000 on online gambling. Too bad the money were set aside to pay rent. Now they were getting close to the eviction date. I was their last hope to avoid it. Both nicely dressed up and neat, I couldn\u00b4t imagine them living on the streets. I had to help them. One of them was strictly against sex but at least jerked off for me. The other one was easier to convince. He was the responsible one of them, cleaning up his friend\u00b4s mess. I think he even tried to truly please me.",
