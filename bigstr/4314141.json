  "description": "I wanted to do something crazy, something I normally never do. After short thinking, I decided to visit a gay bar. I went there very early, hoping to find the place half-empty so I could have a nice chat with someone. Honestly, the place surprised me a lot. There were only four other people and the only gay person there was the bartender. Other guys went there only to have a quiet afternoon without their nagging girlfriends. Who would have thought of that?! One of them agreed to show me his absolutely incredible body but refused to do anything more. The other boy was sitting alone at the bar. I joined him and we had a chat. He looked kind of sad. He was my boy for the day. Fortunately, the bartender was nice enough to let us use their store room.",
