  "description": "This young graphic designer inherited a pretty nice house from his grandpa. Unfortunately, there was still a mortgage on the property so the boy had to work hard to raise enough money every month. He had a well-paid but irregular job. Then suddenly, he didn\u2019t get paid for the work he did on some project. The company that hired him simply cancelled the project and refused to pay. The boy got in serious trouble. He needed 15 000 the next day and I was the only one willing to help. Well, the boy was only 19 years old and quite cute. I was more than willing to help. To help myself in his pants to be precise. I offered him this dirty alternative and I could see the mental struggle going on in his mind. Eventually, we both got what we wanted.",
