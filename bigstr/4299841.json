  "description": "When I woke up today I already felt much better. Had a summer-flu or something like that. But once I was out of the bed I got the right mood to visit another young potential \"client\". He was living in a remote residential area though his place could need a renovation. However, he didn\u00b4t seem to be living in the Czech Republic for such a long time. He had a strong South-Eastern accent. We spoke long about his debts and they summed up to incredible 48 000 CZK. It took me almost all the cash I had on me to make him an offer. And this crazy guy even rejected my generous offer in the first place. Unbelievable. I threatened to leave and as some debts were due the next morning what could he do... he begged me to stay.",
