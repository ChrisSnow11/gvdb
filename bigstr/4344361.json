  "description": "These two boys wanted to borrow money for a nice vacation. I didn\u00b4t understand why they asked me for help. They were obviously doing quite well and there are plenty legitimate lending companies to borrow from. I sensed something fishy was going on. I was right, things started getting interesting very soon. One of the boys spent all the money they saved for the vacations in a casino. He tried to win it back but only made even more debts. The other one was not pleased. They started arguing. I came up with a nice way to settle the argument and become friends again. I offered them to erase the debt and pay for their vacation. It was fun watching them arguing about it. Because I offered them my usual deal. But eventually, I had two toys to play with today.",
