  "description": "I met two boys on the way to a quick lunch. One of them looked very promising so I offered them to pay the bill in exchange of a small interview. Unfortunately, the guy I was after was a bit shy or maybe he didn\u00b4t trust me, while the other one was extremely talkative. It took some time to get rid off him so I could continue with the cute one. The garages were full of people, we couldn\u00b4t do much there. So eventually we went to a hotel room to finish the job. The boy liked money very much. He didn\u00b4t want to talk about his occupation but mentioned occasional modeling jobs. That was good news. Models are usually not afraid to show their beautiful bodies. This one definitely wasn\u00b4t. After all, I was paying him serious money.",
