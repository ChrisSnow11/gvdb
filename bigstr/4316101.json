  "description": "This boy was very lucky. He found a girl he loved, she was hard working and her mother let them stay at a flat she owned. Starting a family is not easy but his rich and hard working girlfriend made it easier. Still, our boy managed to screw things up. They both put their money together to furnish the new home. The boy had some debts she didn\u00b4t know about and they were coming due. So he simply used part of their money. He dodged one problem only to get into more serious one. He was even afraid about ending homeless. That\u00b4s how much he was scared of his girlfriend\u00b4s reaction. I could hardly ask for more. Scared boys are so easy to manipulate. The decision wasn\u00b4t easy for him, I could tell that from the moment I made him my usual proposition.",
