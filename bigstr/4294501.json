  "description": "What I am gonna do with the rest of this sunny day? I just looked around and I saw a young lad walking into the opposite direction and he seemed to be a bit pissed. So I stopped him and asked what was going on. He was obviously trying to have some fun here in Prague. Without any major success so far. But poor little guy, he came from a city so far that he for sure expected something great to happen here in Prague. Young Roman was just 20yo, without any higher education, with a shitty job and most importantly he was here all alone, by himself \"lost\" in Prague. How lucky I am actually, cause this was the perfect situation to trick and seduce some young, innocent and shy dude. He was the sight I truly wanted to see today.",
