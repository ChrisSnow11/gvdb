  "description": "Another boy from a small town in my office. This poor boy tried so many jobs only to get screwed over by crooked employers. One day he said to himself enough with the crappy jobs, I want to do something meaningful and well-paid. Too bad he couldn\u00b4t find anything. He was unemployed for a year and then decided to try his luck in Prague. He was a bartender and even though he had a very little experience, I decided to give him a chance. Night live in Prague is booming and there is always a shortage of handsome boys working behind a bar. I could tell he loved the job offer. I\u00b4m sure he didn\u00b4t expect to work this much to get it. He was kinda greedy and wanted extra money. Too bad I don\u00b4t give up my money easily. Not sure he really enjoyed our interview till the end.",
