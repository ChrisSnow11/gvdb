  "description": "Relationships at work can often be tricky. One stupid colleague can make the time you spent in the job unbearable. This boy had to put up with a co-worker who was frequently under influence of various stuff. They both worked at a warehouse and our boy had to listen to insults from this guy every day. A few weeks back he finally lost his temper and hit him in the face. The guy learned the lesson but our boy broke a thumb during the fight. He lost his job and had to stay home on benefits. He ran out of money fast and his debts started piling up. So he called me and asked for 25 000. I was in a bit kinky mood so his plaster cast kind of turned me on. He was very much against any physical contact but I managed to talk him into it. He was at my mercy, anyways.",
