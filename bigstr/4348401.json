  "description": "I went to the town hall today to pick up my new driving license. As you know me I never leave the house without my little cam. Actually, the weather was again quite annoying since it was again snowing. I didn\u2019t bother at all when I saw this guy passing by. He was not really talkative, and when we finally started to have a conversation, he was even a bit strange. Maybe he simply didn\u2019t want to talk to a stranger. However, I found out that he came to Prague for some shopping. Certainly there are more malls here than anywhere else in the Czech Republic. And he was still a student and therefore always in need of some extra money. Bingo. He just met Mr. Extra-money. I was about to make some nasty proposals, but I really wasn\u2019t sure how he would react\u2026",
