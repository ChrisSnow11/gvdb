  "description": "An exotic boy from The Far East asked for my help today. I think he was just a spoiled guy that couldn\u2019t manage his money properly. He was a student living in a rented apartment. His parents were supporting his lazy ass. Even his girlfriend lent him a few thousand Crowns to furnish his flat with some essentials. To him it meant things like a TV or computer, of course. It would be okay to buy unnecessary stuff if he still had the money. But our boy liked to party. One night he spent all his savings on partying. Now he was getting desperate because he promised his parents and his girlfriend to use the money to furnish his flat. He needed a loan no matter what. Well, he wasn\u2019t overly enthusiastic about my proposition.",
