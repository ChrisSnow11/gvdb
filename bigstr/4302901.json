  "description": "This meeting started quite ordinary. The boy was living at his sister for some time and definitely outstayed his welcome. Not paying her any rent was probably the main reason. She wanted 10 000 and him out by Friday. He found a new flat but needed money to pay the deposit and rent for the first month. He was broke so he asked me for help. He wasn\u00b4t happy about my special deal but 30 000 was too good to let the offer go. In the same moment he agreed, his girlfriend showed up behind the doors! I almost had a heart attack. Thank god he told her about our meeting so she let us finish the deal. We just had to be really quiet because she was next door watching cartoons. Only if she had known what her boyfriend was doing...Afterwards, I just creeped out unnoticed.",
