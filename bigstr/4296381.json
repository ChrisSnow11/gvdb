  "description": "The Vynohradska is one of the most trendy shopping streets in Prague. A lot of artists and students live here. For me it means: a lot of cute boys. Today I was a little bit late because an old friend visited me. So I had to start my hunt in the evening. It was almost dark when I approached the first guy. I was quite open and told him that he had the looks to be a model. He somehow realized my real intentions I guess. Dammit - he was so cute. Anyway. Just a few meters away I noticed a small, young guy waiting in front of a shop-window. He looked very young indeed - so I asked him several times if he was really 18. He was. And he wanted to sell his mobile because he needed some cash. Bingo!",
