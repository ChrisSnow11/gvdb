  "description": "Architecture is a very interesting thing to study. Unfortunately, it\u00b4s not easy to turn such an education into a real job. Unemployment of people with this degree is very high everywhere, the Czech Republic is no exception. This boy find out about that very soon. He graduated in June and up until now, he wasn\u00b4t able to find a decent job. It all changed today. I had a nice junior position at an architecture firm available, a great job to gain experience and connections. The boy was dirt poor. It\u00b4s hard to get by when you live off an occasional part-time job. On the other hand, his misfortune was my blessing, so to speak. He resisted a lot to my initial offer, but when he caved in to it, things started to pick up the pace very quickly. It was only the matter of price with this guy.",
