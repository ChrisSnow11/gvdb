  "description": "Christmas markets in Prague are full of visitors. Prices are very steep, though. That\u00b4s why it\u00b4s not easy to find locals around. Still, I wanted to make a nice Christmas video for you guys and this place was a natural starting point. It didn\u00b4t take too long and I found two boys who came to Prague for a visit and to party. Two good friends alone in Prague... No way I was going to let them go. One of them was wearing a Santa\u00b4s cap and was ready to have some fun. It was easy to talk him into doing something unconventional. The other friend was quite shy but that complicated things only slightly. When I watched their first kiss-for-money, I knew this day will be incredible. It was freezing outside so we decided to go to my apartment and continue there. Inside the boys started warming up pretty quickly, and I\u00b4m not talking only about temperature.",
