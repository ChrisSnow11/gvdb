  "description": "I think this guy was very happy just a year ago. He started a family and got engaged. The future looked bright. He rented a nice place, had a job, even though it was nothing fancy. But something had to go wrong. When I arrived he was a wreck. He was two months behind with the rent. His fiancee was threatening to take the family and leave. He looked totally stressed out and exhausted. Nothing that would break my heart, of course. I immediately noticed his body, he was a nice gym material. The guy was not happy about my lending terms but after a silent moment of hard thinking he agreed. His body exceeded my expectations, especially the abs were superb. Maybe, he even liked our little stress release. He cummed like if he just got out of prison.",
