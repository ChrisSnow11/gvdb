  "description": "My good friend Peter just loved being the Czech Hunter recently and begged me to try him again sometimes. As many of you guys wrote me that he was cool I agreed. And it was worthy. He started his search in a calm suburban area of Prague and at first it looked like a bad idea. He was almost ready to admit defeat when he spotted a youngster getting fined for stowaway. What an opportunity! The boy looked like he\u00b4s going to cry so Peter dashed in to save the day and paid the fine for the boy. He was so happy he agreed to do a little interview. The guy was almost too perfect. Fresh out of school, unemployed, and totally broke. Living in Prague on your own is not easy. And Peter was more than happy to help him further. For a price.",
