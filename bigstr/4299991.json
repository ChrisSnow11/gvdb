  "description": "This guy looked very cute and had a pretty apartment. He was a genuine sports fanatic. He spent an awful lot of money on sports equipment, including a new bike. Well, better than spending it on roulette, I guess. A 25 000 Crowns customer loan from a sharkish lending company. I couldn\u00b4t wish for a better guy. He was good looking and had a cute smile. Also he was smart enough to see benefits of my special offer. He was really scared of debt-collectors. That\u00b4s why he understood that it\u00b4s maybe better to get ass fucked than kicked. I hope the bike was worth it, he had to work hard for it. We used every piece of furniture available in his flat and finished with him lying on the floor covered in my cum. I like sport, especially when it opens asses for me.",
