  "description": "I just love playing football with my friends. Unfortunately, the last play was a bit rough and I ended up with an injured leg. Nothing serious but I decided to stay home for the whole week. It\u00b4s so great to be my own boss. I charged one of my best guys to handle the \"special\" job interviews for me. In my opinion, he did a very good job. I would love to know what do you think about him. Anyways, the guy who came to the interview was quite inexperienced and expected a big salary. Which is typical these days. It took some time to go through the available jobs but eventually we found the perfect one for him. To my surprise he was okay with paying the fee. He had friends to borrow from. Luckily, my guy knew how to convince him about the benefits of our \"special\" offer.",
