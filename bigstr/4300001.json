  "description": "At first I thought I met an angel. That\u00b4s how cute and innocent this 19 years old boy looked. Too bad that beautiful face can\u00b4t save one from stupid mistakes. The boy got into trouble but instead off pulling himself together he started to make one stupid decision after another. Lending 8 000 at a huge interest? Why not. Getting a consumer loan to buy a new TV? Sure thing. Thank god I got there before he could totally wreck his life. He needed 40 000. Which is not a small amount in the Czech Republic. Lucky for him, I was in a generous mood that day. I even taught him a valuable life lesson: If you\u00b4re really desperate, you will do anything to save your skin. When I was done with him, he was barely able to sit down.",
