  "description": "Today I tried my luck in the southeast of Prague. Not the most beautiful area. But certainly good for searching. So I stopped an attractive guy in his mid-thirty's. He was quite open. Especially when I showed him my money. But he was too afraid because of his job. The funny thing was that he tried to offer me his girlfriend. Well, I rejected. A few minutes later a young lad passed my way. A very funny boy I must say. He immediately agreed to strip in the middle of the street for as little as 1.000. When I offered him a good amount he didn't hesitate but followed me into a nearby park. He allowed me to touch him and he started to suck. What an angel. He had pain when I fucked him. But as his tattoo already says: \u201cLife is a fight\u201d. Well, today he won his fight.",
