  "description": "I love the main station in Prague. I often go there because I had luck many times before. But today things were different. I just started to look around when a boy approached me. Yes. You got it right. He approached me. He asked me for some change for the ticket-machine. Of course I offered him more than just my change. I started my interview-strategy. But while I was totally focussed on my conversation someone grabbed my shoulder from behind. Some security guys insisted that I should switch off my cam. Well, you can see yourself what happened next. Anyway. At least the boy didn\u00b4t leave. He lost all of his money with gambling and was more than happy about my offers.",
