  "description": "This time I went on a lovely trip up North. I got a call from a boy who needed 30 000 Crowns but wasn\u00b4t from Prague. He moved to Liberec because he got an IT job there. His girlfriend wasn\u00b4t happy about it and broke up with him. Our guy couldn\u00b4t afford to live alone that\u00b4s why he got a roommate. And that was the source of his problems. After a month, they couldn\u00b4t stand each other anymore. The boy decided to rent his own flat and needed my help to do so. His job wasn\u00b4t paid very well so he couldn\u00b4t meet our lending terms. That\u00b4s why I offered him a naughty alternative. He agreed quite quickly, I guess he disliked his roommate a lot. To suck and fuck like this little devil, you have to be really motivated. I guess, I should be thankful to his stupid roommate.",
