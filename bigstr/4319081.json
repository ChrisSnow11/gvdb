  "description": "When we decided to start our agency we expected that all the boys who are calling live in a rather messy surrounding. Well, I already found out that that was not the truth. But this time the guy totally surprised me. He lived in an expensive apartment. Modern, clean and well-furnished. He told me that he even bought a new BMW. But as he recently lost his job he had problems paying both. His apartment and his car. He told me that he already found a new job - but the money would come too late. So I was obviously his last help. I realized the potential and decided to be a bit more arrogant than usually. A nice feeling to make a quite successful young guy go on his knees and suck for help.",
