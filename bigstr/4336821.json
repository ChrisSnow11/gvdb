  "description": "I stopped for kebab today. Waiting in the line, I met a young guy. I asked him if he could wait for me. I pretended I need to ask him something important. He went to Prague to visit his friend and was killing time till the meeting. He was fresh out of school so he was enjoying the summer holidays and had too much time to waste. Lucky bastard. I was a bit surprised that he bought pizza instead of kebab- maybe he had very bad memories regarding kebabs. We chat for a few minutes and I think he started to enjoy our conversation. He was that kind of guy I\u00b4d like to go party with. When I started giving him my usual challenges he became so shy that I had to rent us a hotel before he would even take off his T-shirt. But there his shyness disappeared very quickly.",
