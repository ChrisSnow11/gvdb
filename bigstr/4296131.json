  "description": "This time I met a very cute boy waiting for a bus. He seemed to be quite open-minded but he didn\u00b4t give me enough time to even explain what I want from him. In other words: he used his last chance to run away from me. Bad luck. So I walked down the street and after a few meters already - at the next bus-stop - I saw a second boy. With a very interesting face. He seemed to be quite busy with his mobile and when I approached him he told me that he visited his mum because he wanted to lend some money. That was more information than I asked for. And more information than I needed to start my little game. I don\u00b4t want to tell you too much: but he had a really nice hard-on.",
