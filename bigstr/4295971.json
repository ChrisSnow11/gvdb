  "description": "The weather is getting better these days. I\u00b4ve met a dude, with his hoodie on he looked a bit dangerous. But that\u00b4s what I like. Party lover who rides a bike. Didn\u00b4t speak nicely about his girlfriend. She doesn\u00b4t want to live with him and he has to pay the whole rent by himself. That\u00b4s good to hear for me. I can help him out with the payment for rent. Now it\u00b4s just all about searching for his prize and all my desires will be fulfilled. Another great thing is that he has his apartment ready for us to use. Great day ahead of me, I am sure. He is Russian, so it\u00b4s bit difficult for me to understand, but it won\u00b4t be a problem, especially not cause we won\u00b4t really talk too much. I can\u00b4t wait to release all the tension I have in me this week.",
