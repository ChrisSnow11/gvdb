  "description": "Today I noticed a handsome guy handing out leaflets. He didn't choose a very smart spot because people were totally ignoring him. He was quite happy that I took the leaflet and I started asking questions about the products it promoted. Sadly, he couldn't tell me much, but I was interested in something else anyways. I convinced the dude to take a smoke break so we could talk about more important things. He told me he was struggling financially and part-time jobs like this were his only source of income. This was his lucky day, almost a late Christmas miracle. He met someone who would improve his situation a lot. I was willing to give him everything I got. Damn, I would even go to an ATM for more cash if needed. He was that gorgeous.",
