  "description": "I have never ever fucked a professional painter in my life. I can\u00b4t say it was something I was looking for but the prospect put a smile on my face. The boy was a typical artist. He was neck deep in debts and blew his last money on hookers. More precisely, on four hookers during one night. He even remembered their names. He fucked away the last money he had and needed my help. The boy organized a big exhibition where he wanted to present his work to a broader audience. Now, he couldn\u00b4t pay for it. The exhibition was supposed to be his last chance to sort out his perpetual financial problems. He even tried to sell me some of his paintings. They were nice but I\u00b4m not much of an art fan. I prefer tight assholes instead.",
