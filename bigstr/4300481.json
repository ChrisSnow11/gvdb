  "description": "I am starting to believe that every single dude in this city is in debts. Since we\u00b4ve opened our agency we are receiving dozens of emails every day. This time i picked a blonde, early 20 student living in a small condo in the centre. As I walked into his apartment I\u00b4ve almost thrown up. Mess and dirty clothes and left overs from food deliveries. In that very moment I have decided to be as nasty to him as I am able to be. And trust me that I really can be a bitch. I asked him about his debt and as every time it was the same story: phone monthly fee, speeding ticket and of course rent. C\u00b4mon, rent , really? The most basic regular expense. Oh my friend you deserve this and you aren\u00b4t gonna enjoy what I am about to do to you.",
