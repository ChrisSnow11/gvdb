  "description": "Being an artisan is not easy these days. This guy studied to be a carpenter and the start of his career looked very promising. His father left him his carpentry shop so our boy could have his own business. Unfortunately, he chopped one of his fingers off. That happens in this trade but the business took a big hit while he was recovering. He managed to keep the shop rolling for another six months and then he had to close it down. He had too few orders to keep it profitable. He gave up and worked at some terrible car factories and repair shops. He hated all those jobs and dreamed of being a carpenter again. I decided to give him a chance because he looked like a decent guy. Decent and pretty good looking. He was too broke to be able to afford our mediation fee.",
