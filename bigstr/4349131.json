  "description": "It looks like giving my former customers rewards for sending me their friends in need is starting to pay off. This fresh college graduate needed money to pay his debts and one of his friends recommended our company. Of course his friend somehow forgot to mention a few important details. Our boy promised to renovate his newly rented flat. In exchange the owner didn\u00b4t want the deposit and rent for a few months. To keep the promise, he had to take a small loan. Then he lost his job and his car broke down. He needed 25 000 to solve his financial crisis. He didn\u00b4t look too desperate so I wasn\u00b4t sure if I should go ahead. Still, his cute face and blond hair was enough for me to make him a naughty proposal. He went absolutely ballistic and threw me out. Really?",
