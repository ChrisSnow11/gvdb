  "description": "This boy rented an empty flat and wanted to furnish it. He looked worth my time so I was willing to help. He wrote down a few items he needed badly, especially a new TV was very important. He looked almost like a boy writing a list to Santa Claus. No one else was eager to lend him money because of his criminal record. I overlooked the minor crimes he committed when he was young and explained him my terms. He wanted the new stuff really badly. He sucked me nicely and after that we tried out his red sofa, the only piece of furniture he had in the living room. He was getting a new one from me so he did not mind that we made it a little dirty. I could see the relieve in his eyes when it was finally over.",
