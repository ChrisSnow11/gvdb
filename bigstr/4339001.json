  "description": "There is a teeming cultural life in Prague. Streets are filled with buskers and musicians, which can be amusing, or annoying. Depending on your mood. I was in a very good mood when I met two young musicians playing at a square in the Old Town. It\u00b4s not an easy spot for hunting because Czechs are quite difficult to come across. The young street artists were just perfect. I quickly chose the younger one.When he told me he just turned 18, I could feel my cock getting hard right there. And he was unemployed. I promised him a much better job than begging in the streets, he was interested. Near the square there is a very nice hotel with rooms just for \"quick meetings\". I lured the boy in there for a \"casting\". It always works. Who wouldn\u00b4t like to work as a model?",
