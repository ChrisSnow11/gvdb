  "description": "This guy was a piece of work. He broke up with his girlfriend, who just delivered a baby. Of course he didn\u2019t pay alimony assigned by the court. Instead he moved to Prague to find a good job and start a new life. The fact that he had to call for my help was a very telling testament of how well he did. Have I mentioned that the guy was on probation? But he didn\u2019t care. Driving without having a valid license? No problem. But his luck run out when he scratched a car. The driver was pretty angry but agreed to get 15 000 for his silence. Our boy didn\u2019t want to go to jail so he needed 20 000 to pay the guy and the alimony debt. That was why I was invited to his lovely apartment. The guy was well-build and I was definitely ready to give his ass good pounding.",
