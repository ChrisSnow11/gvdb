  "description": "This guy was funny. He was constantly broke, he had no job, yet he lived in a large apartment with a terribly high rent. And he threw parties whenever he managed to put a few Crowns together. He smoked like a chimney which put a big hole in his budget, too. I liked it, I\u00b4m fed up with all those depressed self-pity guys I meet all the time. He looked very open-minded to me so I expected this to be easy. He surprised me. This guy didn\u00b4t like gays at all. He got really offended by my offers and started yelling at me. I was a little upset, to be honest. I almost expected a fist fight. Then he started to bargain. He wanted more money from me. I was really horny so eventually I agreed. I don\u00b4t like being taken advantage of like this so I decided to give him a really rough ride.",
