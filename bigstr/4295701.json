  "description": "It was a beautiful day so I decided to go on a little trip. I chose the part of Prague that is almost at the outskirts of the city. When I arrived, I spotted a beautiful rock that was overlooking the whole area. I decided to get there, I just had to find myself a guide. Luckily, I stumbled upon a young man who came there to visit his parents. He knew the area and was willing to take me to the rocky hill. Along the way we chatted about various things, then we got to relationships. The boy turned out to be bisexual with plenty of experience with both boys and girls. I thought he would be easy to talk into some nasties but he was incredibly greedy. He knew that I was horny and willing to pay a lot. In the end, that innocent looking boy cost me all my money. But the fun we had was worth it.",
