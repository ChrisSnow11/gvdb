  "description": "This boy from Moravia was quite ordinary except for a very interesting hobby. He liked to go swimming outside, during winter. He claimed it had many beneficial effects on his body. Of course I was eager to see the body. Swimmers usually have pretty impressive physique and endurance. The two qualities I prefer in my young job applicants. I\u00b4m not that easy to satisfy. This boy took some time before he decided to show me his figure. I didn\u00b4t understand his hesitation, he definitely had nothing to be ashamed off. After that, the interview went off the rails a little bit. But the little surprises like this are the main reason why I love my job. I\u00b4m sure the poor boy was surprised much more than I was. I hope his new job was worth all the effort he put into our little interview.",
