  "description": "I loved my job. But when I visited Jiri from Czechhunter half a year before and when I saw that his little homepage allowed him to cancel his old job - I was really jealous. My name is Jan and I am a sales-guy from Prague. Some people call me a bit arrogant but I still think I am a nice guy. I have the ability to persuade people - a bit like Jiri - but still different. So I met with two of my best friends and we decided to put our money together to found an agency. We placed some ads and the message was: you are young, good looking and male? You have debts? We offer our help! I was quite nervous when the first guy called. He wasn\u2018t actually what I expected him to look like. He was so naive... but a good fuck.",
