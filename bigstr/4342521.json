  "description": "Every week I meet new young men. They all have something in common: their debts. I always listen to their stories. How it happened and why. But every now and then I meet some special guys who have a special story to tell. This time I got a call from a young man who lost his job and who has problems paying his rent. So far nothing new. But when I visited him I noticed that he was not that typical type of client. He simply broke his arm and  as he worked at a construction site he will be unemployed for several months now. And as he didn\u00b4t have an insurance he was eager to meet me. He thought that I might offer him the loan which his bank refused to give. But would he accept my special conditions, too?",
