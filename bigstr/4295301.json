  "description": "Hunting in front of a high-school sounds always promising. Because the bigger the risk, the bigger the reward. Today I met Martin and Filip, two classmates and friends. Both 18 years old and super cute. They were tough to talk with, maybe I looked like a granddad to them. Especially Martin was a bit edgy. He made this hunt very expensive and difficult. But I had one unexpected ally. I think Filip had a crush on Martin, which made things considerably easier. When Martin wanted to leave, Filip always convinced him to continue with my sick challenges. It felt almost like a date. I took them to a park where I told them to kissed on a bench in a very romantic way. But they were both very shy outside so we ended up in my room. I bet this Filip couldn\u00b4t believe his luck at first.",
