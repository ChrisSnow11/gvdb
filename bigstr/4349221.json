  "description": "Please let me introduce Jan, our new colleague. He recently joined our team and is eager to proof his \"counseling abilities\". He has a funny attitude towards his job. He doesn\u00b4t consider sex as sinful at all. Not even the fact that most of the clients are straight would ever change his mind. So he is exactly that kind of guy which fits our team perfectly. Today he had his first appointment. The guy who called lived in some sort of social housing. This is a place where you can go when you have lost your apartment already. It is not a nice place but it\u00b4s really cheap. Jan had a different approach towards this guy. He wrote down all his debts and offered to pay them one by one. For an adequate reward of course.",
