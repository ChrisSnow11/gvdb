  "description": "I think confidence is a very useful trait. But today applicant was too much. He came dressed like to a disco and acted like he owned the place. I almost start laughing when this wimp asked for 30 000 Crowns. Come on, be serious! The warehouse job didn\u2019t exactly drop his jaw, nor did my dirty proposition. The other boy today was a combination of shy and smart-ass. He studied at a medical school but ended up being a gardener, life can be strange sometimes. I think he saw the job as a opportunity to change his life. But the fee was simply too much. I have a soft spot for footballers so I had to convince this innocent boy to do some nasties. I was still angry about the first guy so I asked quite bluntly. And he agreed! Why are the most innocent the easiest to corrupt?",
