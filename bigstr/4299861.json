  "description": "Another boy who overestimated his financial means. Why save money when you want a TV or some other unnecessary stuff? Simply borrow the money and buy anything you desire. Just don\u00b4t cry when you suddenly loose your job. The only thing that saved this boy was his girlfriend working her fingers to the bone to provide for both of them. I see that often these days. Men aren\u00b4t really men anymore. I offered him an elegant solution, as usual. He was disgusted by the offer! I don\u00b4t hear such strong words very often. I guess he was scared it would involve too much work. All I wanted from him was to lie down and spread the ass open! When it was all over, I bet he was relieved how easily he solved all his problems. Just don\u00b4t tell your girlfriend, little man.",
