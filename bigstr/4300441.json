  "description": "This guy was scary. I mean, he was harmless, polite, and nice. But his appearance was intimidating. It has been a few days and I still have no idea what to think about him. He looked very tough, I mean proper tough, not like a wannabe gangster. I think this guy had a pretty nasty background. But I didn\u00b4t care. I patiently listened through his ridiculous and incoherent story about \"loosing\" some goods from a warehouse where he used to work and then agreed to help him. He looked pretty scared of his former boss, who demanded payment for the loss. He was even frightened to go outside of his flat because someone might recognize him. For a tough guy he was quite gentle and willing to ass fuck. Maybe prison taught him how to handle a cock.",
