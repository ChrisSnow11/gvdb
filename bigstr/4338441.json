  "description": "Even the best of intensions can backfire badly. This boy wanted to help his grandmother and his friend. The old lady wanted to refurnish her flat, so he ordered a custom-made furniture from a friend who was a carpenter. Unfortunately, the grandmother died and left him both the furniture and the bill to pay. Did I mention he was behind with his rent, too? Not an easy situation, so I offered him my usual refinancing package. He wasn\u00b4t really impressed, I think he resented gays, actually. Maybe it was shyness. Indeed he was a bit shy, but in this case it was a good thing: I haven\u00b4t been fellated this gently for a long time. He even cleaned my cock after I was done with his ass. Such a lovely and caring guy.",
