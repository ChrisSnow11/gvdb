  "description": "This badass worked at a gym. Everyone can be a receptionist or a gym instructor these days, no surprise his salary wasn\u00b4t exactly spectacular. But the real problems started when his girlfriend lost her job. Suddenly, it was all up to him and the debts started to pile up. He was unable to pay rent anymore so he took quick loans to gain time. When I arrived, he was 35 000 in debt and the flat owner was ready to evict our poor guy and his girlfriend. He didn\u00b4t tell her about our little meeting. His girlfriend was firmly against any other loan. He was so desperate that he lied to her and met me behind her back. Maybe he was even glad when I offered him a solution which would kept his conscience clean.",
