  "description": "When people talk about Czech boys they always think about the golden boys of Prague. This is actually not quite fair. Because the further you go East - that\u00b4s at least my opinion - the more beautiful the boys are. Today I met a young lad from Ostrava. A sportive student of economy. He came to Prague to visit a friend. And as his friend has to work daytime he made some sort of a sightseeing trip. I noticed him in front of a church at Namesti Miru. He seemed to have noticed me before running around with my cam. So he was already curious why I was doing so. I started to ask him some adult questions. He seemed quite open. Especially for money. But then he turned out to be more shy than I expected.",
