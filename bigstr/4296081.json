  "description": "Half the day I was spending in front of a tennis-court. My idea was to talk a young tennis guy into my little games. So I talked to 3 quite cute guys - but nothing. After a few hours I got bored but I decided to not give up yet and to try my luck in front of an ice-hockey-stadium. It was already late afternoon and I was sure that I missed the games there this day. I was about to leave when I saw this young guy with an obviously great body and this typical 500 kg bag indicating that he was a hockey-player. He was originally from Slovakia before he moved to Prague and played hockey since he was 10 years old. I offered him money to see him in his dress. He agreed... not knowing that I above all wanted to see his body when he would change his clothes :-)",
