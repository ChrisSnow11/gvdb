  "description": "I went to my friend\u00b4s party hoping for a nice catch. Unfortunately, I wasn't feeling well so I was unable to film. At least I made a new friend there. We got together and talked. We even added each other as friends on Facebook. Nothing unusual. Two days ago he wrote me a message. He was asking me for help. He got himself into serious financial trouble. Being a nice guy, I agreed to meet him and discuss his problem. Obviously, I had my camera ready this time. The guy tried to look cool and hip but I sensed that he was in big trouble. He was new in Prague and without a stable job. This is always the best combination for me. Luckily, I brought a big pack of money to this meeting so I could play with him a little. I had a lot of fun with this cute boy.",
