  "description": "Today I received an email from a guy who lived quite far away. He answered to one of our online ads. But as he attached a face picture I agreed to visit him. It was a quite long way to the north of Bohemia. I arrived a bit later than expected but when he opened the door I realized that he looked even better than on the picture which he sent me. He lived in a quite nice apartment. It was clean and the boy wore nice clothes as well. We talked long about his problems. Nothing special. Rent, cellphone bill, some friends who lend him money and want it back right now. I liked him a lot as he looked naive and innocent. First he rejected my conditions. But I certainly wouldn\u00b4t give up so easy after such a long ride.",
