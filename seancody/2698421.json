  "description": "<p>Stuart loves to surf.</p>\n<p>He's been doing it since he was five.</p>\n<p>&quot;I go every day that I can,&quot; he said. &quot;There aren't waves every day, but when there's waves I go.&quot;</p>\n<p>He lives on the east coast and had never even seen the Pacific Ocean, until he came to visit us.</p>\n<p>He was anxious to give it a try, so that was one of the first things we did.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the waves were pretty weak!</p>\n<p>&quot;It was fun,&quot; he said. &quot;The water is a lot colder here than back home though!&quot;</p>\n<p>He's on a break from school and trying to save up enough money to return.</p>\n<p>&quot;College is expensive!&quot; he said. &quot;But I'm getting there.&quot;</p>",
