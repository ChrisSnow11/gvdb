  "description": "Chad loves football!\n\"I've been playing it since I was a kid,\" he said. \"All through middle school and high school... I was on the football team...\"\nHe's 21 now and playing on a collegiate level.\n\"So you're good then I take it?\"\n\"I like to think so,\" he said. \"It just takes a lot of practice.\"\nChad is certainly built for it too. He's 210 pounds of muscle!\n\"I work out 6 to 7 days a week,\" he said. \"I spend a lot of time in the gym.\"\nChad's muscles are really nice, but I liked his balls the best \u2014 he's got some great low hangers!",
