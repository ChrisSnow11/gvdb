  "description": "<p>Clinton is from the South, and boy, is he from the South!</p>\n<p>I went to pick him up from the airport and he was wearing a cowboy shirt, cowboy boots, and a cowboy hat.  I don't think he'd ever flown before because he just seemed so excited about the whole experience.</p>\n<p>Working with Clinton was a hoot.  Some of the things he said just cracked me up (check out the blooper in the interview) and I loved his southern accent. </p>\n<p>He's got an adorable boyish face, with pale skin, really nice muscles, and a cock with a bit of a curve to it.</p>",
