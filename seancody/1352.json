  "description": "Samuel wants to move to Los Angeles to become an actor. He said he loves movies and would love to be in a romantic or dramatic film.\nWhen I asked him what his favorite movie was, he said \"The Weatherman.\" OK, I guess I was expecting something else!\nSamuel is extremely personable and he has a deep voice.\n\"You know,\" I told him, \"if the acting thing doesn't work out you should try for radio or voice work.\"\nHe also plays the violin and piano.\n\"I wanted to be a concert pianist,\" he said. \"But that's pretty tough to break into.\"\nSamuel has a nice swimmer's body with olive, Mediterranean skin. For a lean guy, he's got really broad shoulders and big lats.\nOh, and he has size 13 feet!",
