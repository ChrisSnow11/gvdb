  "description": "<p>Paul considers himself a &quot;professional chiller&quot;. I am not too sure what that entails but since he is an aspiring musician, I think it might require a lot of time with a guitar, a pen and a piece of paper. But, he does find the time to hit the gym between his chill sessions. </p>\n<p>He wasn't always a tall, built, 21-year-old stud. He claims he was actually a bit of a &quot;chubster&quot; when he was younger and he ended up playing a few particular farm roles in some school plays that had him in some interesting costumes.Those days are long gone and his dedication in the gym have really paid off!</p>\n<p>I did notice something interesting in my time with him. He really seems to get off on pulling and playing with his balls!</p>\n<p>&quot;So I was noticing yesterday that you like to pull on your balls,&quot; I commented. &quot;You pull on your balls when you jerk off?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Tell me why.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Gets me harder I guess.&quot; </p>\n<p>&quot;Do you like when people suck on your balls?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Ummm\u2026 yeah,&quot; he replied with a huge grin!</p>",
