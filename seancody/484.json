  "description": "God, the Midwest keeps pumping out some fucking hot young men!\nDanny had never been out of his home town, so coming to southern California was a big deal for him. He was completely wide eyed and amazed at every little thing. The palm trees, the beach, the blonde girls with the big boobs and butt tattoos \u2014 everything was new to this sexy little farm boy with the innocent smile.\n\u201cDo you have a girlfriend?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, looking away.\n\u201cDoes she know you\u2019re doing this?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but she\u2019s not happy about it,\u201d he replied.\nThat was the fun part about Danny. Everything you asked him embarrassed the shit out of him. But you could tell he liked it. He liked being dirty.\nIt was mid-morning and we ended up taking him to a friend\u2019s pool. We put him in a tight little swimsuit that barely covered anything. He was splashing around, with a big smile on his face, having the time of his life. Of course, I couldn\u2019t resist asking him to put on a little show. He\u2019s got a sweet, tight ass and his balls are real nice too.\nWhile I'm filming I like to keep a tight leash on the guys. If you give them too much freedom they get into trouble and fuck up the shoot. Afterwards, though, I encourage them to have some fun and they inevitably find the part of town where the girls are easy and there is a bar on every corner.\nDanny was no exception.\nThe morning after his shoot I called him to make sure he was ready to catch his flight. I could tell by the tone of his voice that he was grinning from ear to ear.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d I asked, \u201cYou sound chipper\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI met two girls last night.\u201d\nApparently he fucked both of them all night, and in the ass too. All of this after he\u2019d already gotten off twice in one day for me. Man, to be 20 again\u2026",
