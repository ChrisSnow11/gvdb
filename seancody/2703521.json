  "description": "<p>Henry is a friend of Brandon. They are like brothers &#8212; hanging out, going to the gym... they do just about everything together.</p>\n<p>So when Brandon introduced me to his ginger-stud friend, I was intrigued.  I don't know if it was the freckles or the smile, or maybe those light red pubes.... but he caught my attention right away.</p>\n<p>&quot;He convinced me that this would be a good idea,&quot; Henry said about Brandon. &quot;He was, like... 'Good things come in small packages!' I couldn't tell if he was making fun of me or not!&quot;</p>\n<p>As I got to know him, I discovered that Henry doesn't take himself too seriously.</p>\n<p>&quot;So, what's it like being a ginger?&quot; I asked.</p>\n<p>\t\u201cWell, they say we have no souls!&quot; He laughed. &quot;That's a huge lie! I just like to cuddle. Ginger cuddles for all!&quot;</p>\n<p>This adorable guy was covered from head to toe in freckles, even his ass had some.</p>\n<p>&quot;When I was little I got I in trouble  for taking a marker to myself and playing connect the dots. My mom found me in my room covered head to toe with black marker all over me.&quot;</p>\n<p>I'm sure he was a hand full!</p>\n<p>Henry's laughter was infectious and he always had a smile on his face.</p>\n<p>&quot;You see, I think of it this way,&quot; he said. &quot;Life is fun. I wanna have fun. Lets make people laugh!&quot;</p>\n<p>When he's not running around being the life of the party, Henry is breaking and training horses.</p>\n<p>\u201cYup! I saddle up, rope up and work those bucks out!\u201d he said...</p>",
