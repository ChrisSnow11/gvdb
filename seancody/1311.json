  "description": "Grayson is no stranger to standing in front of the camera. In fact, he started modeling when he was younger and landed some very big-profile bookings, both in runway shows and print. It wasn't all easy at first though. His first walk down a runway almost ended up being a disaster \u2014 his excitement almost made him fall off the runway! After that, he got more relaxed and quite a bit of fun being a model.\nThat fun also included his first man-on-man experience while on a job!\n\"So did you always sleep with girls? Or have you slept with guys?\" I asked.\n\"I've slept with guys,\" he answered confidently and with no hesitation.\n\"What was that like?\"\n\"I always thought about it when I was younger\u2026 but where I am from you're not 'supposed' to do that. I met this guy\u2026 and we hit it off and the next thing you know, we were fucking.\"\n\"Were you the receiver or the giver?\"\n\"It was both. Versatile.\"\n\"What do you like more?\" I asked.\n\"Depends on the mood I am in. Sometimes I wanna fuck... Sometimes I wanna get fucked!\"",
