  "description": "<p>Samuel was born in Brazil but has been living in the United States for the past two years.</p>\n<p>When I asked Samuel if he had any special skills or interests he told me that he's been studying a form of Brazilian martial art for years. Apparently it makes him quite flexible (hmmm...)</p>\n<p>Samuel is gay and says he's more of a top than a bottom. I can't wait to see him put that flexibility to use! </p>",
