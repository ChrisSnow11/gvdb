  "description": "Coleman is the kind of guy who is a straight-A student, athlete, and the type most likely to be voted \u201cmost popular.\u201d He\u2019s got a charming personality, a killer smile, and one of the most amazing asses I\u2019ve ever seen!\n\u201cWhen I was in high school I was the quarterback,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, look!\u201d\nHe pulled out his phone and showed us a picture of him in full gear.\n\u201cDid you have a hard time fitting into the spandex pants,\u201d I asked. \u201cWith your bubble butt?\u201d\nHe laughed. \u201cI guess so,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was probably how people knew it was me. Forget about my jersey number!\u201d\nColeman was born and raised in southern California. He did a lot surfing when he was growing up.\n\u201cMy hair was really long,\u201d he said. \u201cI got it cut off a year or so back.\u201d\n\u201cYou look more like a Ken doll now!\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cSome people say I look like more like a Senator now!\u201d",
