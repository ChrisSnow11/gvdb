  "description": "<p>Owen is definitely a military guy.</p>\n<p>&quot;I enlisted right out of high school,&quot; he said. &quot;It was definitely what I wanted to do...&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;So you learned a lot?&quot; I asked. &quot;Had some interesting experiences?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I had three deployments to Iraq,&quot; he told us. &quot;It was pretty wild.&quot;</p>\n<p>He had originally trained to be a medic, but found he was doing all different kinds of jobs.</p>\n<p>&quot;Whatever they need you to do,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>He  recently got out in order to go to college, where he is studying business management.</p>\n<p>&quot;Is that why you left?&quot; I asked. &quot;To go to school?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I wanted to do something different,&quot; he explained. &quot;When I graduate and get my degree... I may go back.&quot;</p>\n<p>Now that he's a civilian, Owen loves spending as much time in the gym as possible and he loves cooking.</p>\n<p>&quot;The food in the military was awful!&quot; he told us. &quot;I don't miss that!&quot;</p>",
