  "description": "<p>Pierce recently got out of the Marines. He had done his four year stint and decided it was time for something new.</p>\n<p>&quot;It was the best and worst time of my life,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>&quot;Did people know you were gay when you were in there?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;A couple did, yes,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>He had already told us he is gay... bisexual, actually. He said he is still seeing girls here and there, but...</p>\n<p>&quot;More guys than girls, probably,&quot; he confessed.</p>\n<p> &quot;What do you like more about guys than girls?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;They're easy to read,&quot; he said. &quot;Easy to please. We think on the same level.&quot;</p>\n<p>He knows what he wants!</p>\n<p>We had him soap up in the shower and he told us about his  gym locker room fantasy &#8212; meeting a hot guy in the shower and getting &quot;rough!&quot;</p>",
