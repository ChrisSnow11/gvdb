  "description": "Stan is a 25-year-old straight guy.\n\"Are you in the military?\" I asked him when I first met him.\n\"I was,\" he said. \"How did you know?\"\n\"You seem very regimented and you say 'Sir' a lot,\" I explained.\nHe laughed.\n\"Anyone ever tell you that you look a little like George Bush?\" I asked.\n\"Yes sir,\" he said, standing straight with his hands behind his back. \"I do get that a lot.\"\nBesides a passing resemblance to a president whose term is thankfully nearing its end, Stan is pretty darn hunky. He's got a nice wrestler's body with a big package.\nIn fact, he was on the wrestling team in high school, and then went directly into the Marines after graduation. Now that he's out, he's planning on going back to school.",
