  "description": "\u201cSo what\u2019s a good time for you like?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Darius thought for a moment. \u201cIt usually involves me with my shirt off!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad thing!\u201d\n\u201cYes, I love the outdoors,\u201d he said. \u201cPlaying sports, running around, enjoying the sunshine... I\u2019m usually shirtless.\u201d\nDarius has an incredible muscular body so I wasn\u2019t surprised that he isn\u2019t shy about it.\nOne thing that was surprising coming from this stud... he\u2019s scared of spiders! Like, really scared!\nWe were doing some photos under a bridge and when a cobweb hit his face he kind of freaked out!\n\u201cOhhh,\u201d he said after jumping off the perch we had him on. \u201cThey really freak me out!\u201d",
