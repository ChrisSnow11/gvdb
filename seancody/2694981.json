  "description": "<p>Arnold is a soft-spoken, 22-year-old, ex-Marine. He enlisted in the service right out of high school and ended his tour of duty a few months ago.</p>\n<p>Like a lot of Marines, he's direct and to the point, and he's even got the bulldog tattoo.</p>\n<p>He doesn't have a girlfriend, as his deployment schedule allowed him little free time. He does find the time, however, for his favorite hobby, dirt bikes. </p>",
