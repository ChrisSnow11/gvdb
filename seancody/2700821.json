  "description": "<p>Mike is an east coast transplant who is a budding 24-year-old musician. He's definitely got that rock n' roll look to him &#8212; ears pierced, deep voice, and good looks. </p>\n<p>At one point, he managed to get a small group together to play the bars but now he  is really focusing on honing his talents and getting a serious band together. What really captured my attention about Mike was how hairy his sexy muscled body was. I'm not talking about a &quot;happy trail&quot; here. This guy is a happy pasture! If you like hair, then there is no part of Mike's body you won't like.</p>\n<p>&quot;You're pretty hairy!&quot; I exclaimed.</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah, my friends in high school used to call me 'Teen Wolf'.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;So you were this hairy in high school? How old do you think you were when you started getting hairy?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I was the youngest out of my friends... probably thirteen, fourteen years old,&quot; he replied. &quot;Not this hairy, but it was a lot more than everyone else.&quot; </p>\n<p>The nickname bothered him somewhat back then but now he loves his body hair. He says that it creates a great physical sensation when he or someone else touches it. I could tell... he shot his load like a super soaker all over the bed! </p>",
