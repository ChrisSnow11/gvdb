  "description": "\u201cSo you\u2019re not straight, right?\u201d I asked. After meeting Rich and getting to know him I could tell he played for our team.\n\u201cWell,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019m not 100% gay, but also not 100% straight. Let\u2019s just say I like options!\u201d\n\u201cWhich way do you find yourself swinging these days?\u201d\n\u201cTowards men,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cI like being with a man, as a friend, and still being able to fuck!\u201d\nRich is everything you would expect from a boy who grew up in southern California \u2014 everything from his hair, to his attitude, to his adventurous spirit. He really likes having a good time, and his favorite thing is skateboarding. He\u2019s actually pretty good at it, too. Watching this young fit guy grind down the street was pretty impressive!\n\u201cYou are better than I thought you would be!\u201d\n\u201cYep,\u201d he said, looking away. \u201cI\u2019ve been skateboarding since I was 12!\u201d",
