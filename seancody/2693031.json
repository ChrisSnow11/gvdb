  "description": "<p>Laszlo is here from eastern Europe as a student. He learned English specifically to come to the States and apparently it's done him well. As he says in his interview, his accent is quite popular with the girls. Although he's a bit reticent, I found him very charming with his puppy dog eyes and straightforward honesty.</p>\n<p>Laszlo is straight and uncircumcised. When I told him that most of the guys in America are cut, he didn't believe me &#8212; and didn't understand why. I asked him why he hadn't noticed that in the showers at his university and he got kind of embarrassed and said he hadn't looked!</p>",
