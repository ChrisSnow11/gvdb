  "description": "<p>&quot;I'm a shy person,&quot; Martin said. &quot;I'm usually pretty quiet.&quot;</p>\n<p>That was true, but it wasn't a surprise. When I first met Martin I could tell by his puppy-dog eyes and the way he would only cautiously make eye contact that he was kind of a wall flower.</p>\n<p>This kind of intrigued me because sometimes I mistakenly assume that just because someone is hot that they are outgoing.</p>\n<p>&quot;I usually wait for people to talk to me,&quot; he explained. &quot;I'm not sure why. I've just always been that way.&quot;</p>\n<p>Martin classifies himself as &quot;bi-curious,&quot; but he's never done anything with another guy. So maybe we'll see!</p>",
