  "description": "<p>Randall is very, very, very low key.</p>\n<p>He's one of those guys who started out with hesitant one-word answers and then  slowly started to smile and open up.</p>\n<p>He's 19, single, and going to school.</p>\n<p>&quot;School controls my life right now,&quot; he said. &quot;It's what I do for fun.&quot;</p>\n<p>That and football.</p>\n<p>&quot;I've been playing football since I was 9 or 10 years old,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm decent at it.&quot;</p>\n<p>He's close to his parents, and he said they're very supportive of his athletic pursuits. </p>\n<p>&quot;My mom is my #1 fan, so she'd probably say I'm the greatest.&quot;</p>\n<p>Love it!</p>",
