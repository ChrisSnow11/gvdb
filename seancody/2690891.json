  "description": "<p>This video is the last film I did on my vacation to Rio de Janeiro.</p>\n<p>I met these guys on the beach in Ipanema. The biggest guy was the only one who spoke English. He was a personal trainer visiting from Sao Paulo. I spoke with him (and with the other two through him) for over an hour and eventually brought up the subject of doing a video. It took a lot of sweet talking to get them to agree as Brazil is a very religious country and the guys were concerned that their families would find out. But, luckily they agreed...</p>\n<p>I didn't want to do the video in the hotel. The staff there was already suspicious of me as I had been bringing guys in and out all week (hotels in Rio are very different from those in the states). Luckily a friend I met during the trip knew a guy who owned one of the local saunas. After speaking with the owner, we rented the place out for a few hours and brought the guys in.</p>\n<p>Brazilian guys are very, very different from American guys... Brazilians are very wild behind closed doors, but put a camera in front of them and it's a totally different story. It took a bit of time to get them loosened up, but it wasn't long before they were laughing and joking with each other (in Portuguese, of course).</p>\n<p>There are definitely some amazing bodies and dicks in this video...</p>",
