  "description": "<p>Stewart is a 21-year-old bartender from the east coast.</p>\n<p>&quot;I love it,&quot; he said, referring to his job. &quot;I get to meet all kinds of people.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Don't you have to deal with them getting messy sometimes?&quot; I asked.</p>\n<p>&quot;Oh sure,&quot; he replied. &quot;But that's half the fun!&quot;</p>\n<p>Stewart has lived in the same place all his life, but he travels a lot.</p>\n<p>&quot;My girl friend is a flight attendant,&quot; he told us. &quot;She gets free tickets, so we go together a lot.&quot;</p>\n<p>Stewart also loves sports.</p>\n<p>&quot;I was big into lacrosse in high school. I also played football and I wrestled.&quot;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
