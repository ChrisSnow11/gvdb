  "description": "<p>Jonah is a little soured on the concept of marriage.</p>\n<p>He tied the knot right out of high school, at the tender age of eighteen.</p>\n<p>&quot;Did you knock her up or something?&quot; I asked.</p>\n<p>&quot;No, nothing like that,&quot; he said. &quot;I loved her and it just felt right.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Is that what made you get married so young?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Being stuck in a northern state... you find a girl, you better keep her.&quot;</p>\n<p>Apparently, after the ring went on her finger she became a raging bitch.</p>\n<p>He didn't seem to want to go into detail, but he offered: &quot;She was pretty controlling.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;How long have you been divorced?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;About 14 or 15 months.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;So it's a new thing... Are you enjoying being single?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; he said with a sigh of relief. &quot;It's nice.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;So now what's your perfect kind of girl?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;One who's fit and doesn't want to get married.&quot;</p>\n<p>Wow, she must have been bad. I'll never get how these girls who have hot men can be so miserable.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Jonah is enjoying the single life and he has a lot of girls chasing him.</p>\n<p>With his handsome face, perfect hair, and smooth, chiseled body that's not much of a surprise!</p>",
