  "description": "<p>Logan is one really friendly guy!</p>\n<p>He was smiling from the moment I picked him up at the airport to the moment he left.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, when you pick guys up for the first time &#8212; especially guys who don't talk much &#8212; it can be really awkward with all the silence!</p>\n<p>Within ten minutes I felt like I knew everything about him!</p>\n<p>Besides being friendly, he is also really cute, with a nice ripped body.</p>\n<p>The funniest thing he said was his response to the question: &quot;What do you want to be when you grow up?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;A plastic surgeon!&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>&quot;Why is that?&quot; we asked.</p>\n<p>&quot;To make people good looking!&quot; he replied...</p>",
