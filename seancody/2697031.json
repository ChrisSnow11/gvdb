  "description": "<p>Andrew was a fire fighter for a few years before he decided it was time for a career change.</p>\n<p>&quot;It was fun, but really stressful,&quot; he said. &quot;Long hours, and dangerous too.&quot;</p>\n<p>So now he's training to be a police officer. I didn't think there would be much of a difference there, but he seemed excited about it.</p>\n<p>Andrew is 22, single, and he lives on the east coast.</p>\n<p>He hits the gym hard every day. His motivation: impressing the ladies, of course.</p>\n<p>&quot;I used to be skinny,&quot; he said. &quot;The girls didn't respond to that as much as they do now. They love the muscles.&quot;</p>\n<p>His big dick probably doesn't hurt either!</p>",
