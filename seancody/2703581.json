  "description": "<p>Kirk is a midwestern boy that grew up, truly, as country as it gets.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love to hunt,\u201d he told us. \u201cI got my first BB gun when I was five.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat's the craziest thing you've ever shot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSquirrels!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSquirrel meat is great. It\u2019s chewy.\u201d</p>\n<p>What do you do when an adorable boy tells you in a southern twang that he shoots rodents? I just laughed.</p>\n<p>Kirk is currently working as a server to help feed his constant need to tour the world. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been to Rome, Paris, London...\u201d The list went on and on. But he seemed extra excited to be in California.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we are done here I kinda wanna go learn to surf,\u201d he said. \u201c...or see the zoo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirk also has a soft side, and he\u2019s not afraid to admit it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love making romantic home-made dinners,\u201d he admitted.</p>\n<p>Kirk was really fun to be around and he had a natural smile that was contagious.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look really happy,\u201d I said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYup!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCause I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be having this much fun!\u201d</p>",
