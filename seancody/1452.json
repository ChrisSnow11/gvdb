  "description": "Henry is a friend of Brandon. They are like brothers \u2014 hanging out, going to the gym... they do just about everything together.\nSo when Brandon introduced me to his ginger-stud friend, I was intrigued. I don't know if it was the freckles or the smile, or maybe those light red pubes.... but he caught my attention right away.\n\"He convinced me that this would be a good idea,\" Henry said about Brandon. \"He was, like... 'Good things come in small packages!' I couldn't tell if he was making fun of me or not!\"\nAs I got to know him, I discovered that Henry doesn't take himself too seriously.\n\"So, what's it like being a ginger?\" I asked.\n\u201cWell, they say we have no souls!\" He laughed. \"That's a huge lie! I just like to cuddle. Ginger cuddles for all!\"\nThis adorable guy was covered from head to toe in freckles, even his ass had some.\n\"When I was little I got I in trouble for taking a marker to myself and playing connect the dots. My mom found me in my room covered head to toe with black marker all over me.\"\nI'm sure he was a hand full!\nHenry's laughter was infectious and he always had a smile on his face.\n\"You see, I think of it this way,\" he said. \"Life is fun. I wanna have fun. Lets make people laugh!\"\nWhen he's not running around being the life of the party, Henry is breaking and training horses.\n\u201cYup! I saddle up, rope up and work those bucks out!\u201d he said...",
