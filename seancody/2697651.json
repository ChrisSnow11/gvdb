  "description": "<p>Rex is 30 years old and he's a little change of pace!</p>\n<p>He's got a ripped body that is the result of years of &quot;natural&quot; body building. He's been competing in shows and hopes to take first in his division this season. </p>\n<p>After working as a mortgage broker (yeah, I know) for most of his twenties, he's gone back to school to study accounting. His goal is to become a CPA.</p>\n<p>The other thing that is unusual about Rex is that he's married.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's coming up on four years now,&quot; he said. &quot;It's great. I love it.&quot;</p>\n<p>I think the funniest thing he had to say was how he felt about flat-chested women: &quot;You know, I have no personal distaste for them as people,&quot; he said tongue-in-cheek. Then he smiled and said: &quot;I need boobs.&quot;</p>",
