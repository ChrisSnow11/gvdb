  "description": "<p>Dominic is a guy I've been wanting to film for a while. I had met him out on the town a few months ago, but job commitments and his girlfriend (grrr!) just kept him too busy.</p>\n<p>But I'm persistent and eventually I was able to schedule a shoot with him. I really enjoyed working with Dominic because he's open and very comfortable with himself.</p>\n<p>In his interview, he makes reference to being an ex-professional athlete. Check out his form on the field! </p>",
