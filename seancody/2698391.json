  "description": "<p>Lane has really strict parents.</p>\n<p>&quot;I love them,&quot; he said. &quot;But I was very, very happy when it came time to go to college!&quot;</p>\n<p>Apparently, they had really strict curfews and were very particular about whom he could invite to the house. And of course, no girls!</p>\n<p>He described himself as an &quot;A&quot; student in high school who played sports, but was also kind of nerdy.</p>\n<p>&quot;When I turned 18, I decided I wanted to go to school in another state,&quot; he explained. &quot;And when I got there, it was like 'Whew!'&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I didn't know what to do with all the freedom!&quot;</p>\n<p>So now, he's making up for lost time and seeing several girls at once!</p>",
