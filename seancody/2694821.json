  "description": "<p>Willis is one of the most colorful characters I've ever met.</p>\n<p>He's 18 and from Tennessee. He was the star quarterback on his high school football team.</p>\n<p>&quot;I think I got a little bit of a country accent,&quot; he understated. &quot;But I don't think I'm too country.&quot;</p>\n<p>He'd never been away from home, so coming out to visit us was a first for him.</p>\n<p>&quot;A lot of people, like in California and stuff, think we're all running around with no shoes on,&quot; he explained.</p>\n<p>I love how innocent Willis is, and how fondly he speaks of his home state.</p>\n<p>&quot;Which do you like better?&quot; I asked. &quot;Tennessee or California?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Tennessee, definitely,&quot; he said. &quot;It's modernized, actually. We've got malls.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Do you have any brothers or sisters?&quot; I asked.</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah, I got five brothers and two sisters,&quot; he replied.</p>\n<p>He's the youngest of the brothers. All of his siblings are married, and he's dating his high school sweetheart.</p>\n<p>&quot;Do you think you'll get married any time soon?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Probably,&quot; he said. &quot;We'll see I guess.&quot;</p>",
