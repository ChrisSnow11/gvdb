  "description": "\"I'm from the east coast,\" Mitchell told us.\nThat was pretty obvious from the moment I met him. He has a very distinctive accent that tells you exactly where he is from!\n\"When you're away from home, do people comment on your accent?\"\n\"Oh yeah,\" he said. \"I don't really notice it because I'm around it all the time. I have a lot of friends with accents worse than mine!\"\nMitchell is studying to become a graphic designer.\n\"Id' like to do something with the Internet,\" he said.\nMitchell is also really, really friendly.\n\"I love being social. I'm an optimist and you'll rarely find me in a bad mood...\"\nI noticed while we were filming that Mitchell stuck his fingers in his ass a couple of times. After we were done, I asked him about it.\n\"I like it,\" he said. \"It feels really good.\"\nThat made me wonder, so I asked him, \"Are you straight or gay?\"\n\"I'm bi,\" he said. \"I usually go for girls, but occasionally I like to get fucked too!\"",
