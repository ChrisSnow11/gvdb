  "description": "I met Luke through a friend of mine who works at a local bar. Luke is the lead singer in a band that plays the clubs around town. He knew that I was looking for hot guys to film and he expressed an interest in doing a flick or two in order to pick up a little extra cash.\nNow I have a thing for guys in bands... I don't know why, I just do. When I first met Luke, I thought he had a really cute face, but I couldn't tell what his body looked like because of what he was wearing.\nI had him over a few days later and when he took off his shirt I was very pleasantly surprised. He's got great abs and a hot chest with one nipple ring and just the right amount of hair.\nLuke is married and straight as an arrow. He was very nervous about doing his first video and in the movie you can see that he's a little uncomfortable stripping down and jerking off with another guy in the room. At the end of the video I thought I would give him a break... so, I set up the tripod and let him have some fun on his own. I'm actually starting to like the whole tripod thing with these first-timers. It really makes them loosen up a bit!",
