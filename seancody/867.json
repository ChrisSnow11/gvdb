  "description": "Here's an interesting fact about Christopher: He's actually Ross' cousin!\nRoss had decided not to do any more films, because he was getting married and had a child on the way.\nChristopher had quit school and had decided to move to Florida to be with a girl he had just met. He knew about the films that Ross had done and wanted to give it a try \u2014 plus, he knew the money would help give him the start he needed in Florida.\nWhen I met Christopher, I saw the family resemblance right away... the tall, lean, muscular physique and smooth skin. Plus, their personalities are very similar.\nChristopher is a little more outgoing though!",
