  "description": "Arnold is a soft-spoken, 22-year-old, ex-Marine. He enlisted in the service right out of high school and ended his tour of duty a few months ago.\nLike a lot of Marines, he's direct and to the point, and he's even got the bulldog tattoo.\nHe doesn't have a girlfriend, as his deployment schedule allowed him little free time. He does find the time, however, for his favorite hobby, dirt bikes.",
