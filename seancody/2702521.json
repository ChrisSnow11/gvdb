  "description": "<p>Samuel wants to move to Los Angeles to become an actor. He said he loves movies and would love to be in a romantic or dramatic film.</p>\n<p>When I asked him what his favorite movie was, he said &quot;The Weatherman.&quot; OK, I guess I was expecting something else!</p>\n<p>Samuel is extremely personable and he has a deep voice.</p>\n<p>&quot;You know,&quot; I told him, &quot;if the acting thing doesn't work out you should try for radio or voice work.&quot;</p>\n<p>He also plays the violin and piano.</p>\n<p>&quot;I wanted to be a concert pianist,&quot; he said. &quot;But that's pretty tough to break into.&quot;</p>\n<p>Samuel has a nice swimmer's body with olive, Mediterranean skin. For a lean guy, he's got really broad shoulders and big lats.</p>\n<p>Oh, and he has size 13 feet!</p>",
