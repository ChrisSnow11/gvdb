  "description": "<p>Duncan is a  fitness trainer for a midwest franchise of a popular gym.</p>\n<p>He said he loves his job, except for one thing:</p>\n<p>&quot;Sometimes clients don't listen,&quot; he said. &quot;It's my job to help them achieve goals... and sometimes they don't listen.&quot;</p>\n<p>Well, if he's telling them to eat skinless chicken breasts and broccoli all the time, I can certainly understand!</p>\n<p>&quot;I love working there though,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a great way to meet new people.&quot;</p>\n<p>Duncan is 25 and he's been training for about four years.</p>\n<p>&quot;I'd like to start my own gym someday,&quot; he said. &quot;That's probably a ways off, though.&quot;</p>\n<p>The thing that struck me most about Duncan was his eyelashes. They're long and make his blue eyes stand out.</p>\n<p>He also has a smooth, lean body... I bet he looks good in his uniform!</p>",
