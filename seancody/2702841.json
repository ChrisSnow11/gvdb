  "description": "<p>&quot;Man, life is short and I'm just trying to enjoy the ride,&quot; Tucker said, eyes bright and smiling.</p>\n<p>&quot;How's the ride been so far?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;So far its been good. It was a little rocky until I realized you just got to have fun man... just let it happen. And now it's just pretty smooth sailing.&quot;</p>\n<p>Tucker is definitely an easy-going guy. Every part of our experience with him was laid back.</p>\n<p>I definitely got an &quot;open&quot; vibe from Tucker. As in, he might be &quot;open&quot; to anything.</p>\n<p>&quot;Tell me about your first gay experience.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;My first gay experience...&quot; he said. He seemed kind of confused. &quot;Ummm.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I just tried tricking you to see if you actually had one.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah, I was going to say... well it hasn't happened YET...&quot; he replied. And then: &quot;I mean I have a lot of gay friends. I've done a a lot of gay things but never sexual. I've been to gay clubs, parties, dancing and stuff...&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Its a lot more fun.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Dude, gay people are  the nicest people I've ever met... super fun, they know how to party all the time.&quot;</p>\n<p>Tucker's got a tight little body that is mostly smooth.</p>\n<p>&quot;What's your favorite part of your body?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Umm, probably my pecs, they kinda pop,&quot; he said, flexing.</p>\n<p>My favorite part?</p>\n<p>His full, dark, wild bush!</p>",
