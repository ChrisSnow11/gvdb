  "description": "Brent is just impossibly cute! He\u2019s got a bright smile and a certain Southern politeness about him.\nAs I was getting to know him, I noticed that he kept calling me \u2018sir.\u2019\nWhen I asked him about it, he said, \u201cI was brought up to be respectful.\u201d\nI was thankful he didn\u2019t add \u201cof my elders!\u201d\nI also noticed that he was wearing a brand new pair of cowboy boots.\n\u201cI\u2019m from the south,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just always wear boots.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d I said. \u201cWere you raised on a ranch or a farm?\u201d\n\u201cOf course!\u201d he said with a big smile. \u201cI knew how to work the tractor by the time I was twelve.\u201d\nOnce his clothes came off he stopped being polite and started being a little nasty. He kept fingering his ass until he shot a big load.\nI am guessing he is a bottom!",
