  "description": "There is a surf spot nearby that is nearly always crawling with surfers. A friend of mine has a house there and we love to sit on his balcony and watch the guys change in and out of their wetsuits, always hoping for the occasional dropped towel.\nOne Saturday afternoon we were doing just that and I spotted a guy who was the spitting image of Dylan. I mean, this guy looked more like Dylan than Dylan's own brother!\nAs he changed out of his wetsuit, I could see that he had a lean, tight body. So I set my beer down and ran down the stairs and across the street to meet him. As I was talking to him, I noticed how much his demeanor was like Dylan's, especially the Dylan from the early days.\nIt turns out that the next day he was leaving town for a surfing competition. Fortunately, he called me the day he got back!",
