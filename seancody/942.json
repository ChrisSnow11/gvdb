  "description": "Stuart loves to surf.\nHe's been doing it since he was five.\n\"I go every day that I can,\" he said. \"There aren't waves every day, but when there's waves I go.\"\nHe lives on the east coast and had never even seen the Pacific Ocean, until he came to visit us.\nHe was anxious to give it a try, so that was one of the first things we did.\nUnfortunately, the waves were pretty weak!\n\"It was fun,\" he said. \"The water is a lot colder here than back home though!\"\nHe's on a break from school and trying to save up enough money to return.\n\"College is expensive!\" he said. \"But I'm getting there.\"",
