  "description": "<p>Alan is an airplane mechanic and his job has taken him all over the world. He's pretty modest about it, though.</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah, I've been to a few places,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>His favorite?</p>\n<p>&quot;Amsterdam,&quot; he said with a big smile. &quot;Definitely Amsterdam.&quot;</p>\n<p>I wonder why!</p>\n<p>Alan is straight and he says he enjoys meeting women from all over the world.</p>\n<p>&quot;So many different types of women,&quot; he said. &quot;It's incredible.&quot;</p>\n<p>When I was talking with him, a completely off-the-wall question came to mind:</p>\n<p>&quot;So, when you're working on a plane, and there are people inside, do girls flirt with you through the window?&quot;</p>\n<p>I half expected him to give me a funny look, but instead he laughed like he knew exactly what I was talking about!</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; he said. &quot;Actually it happens quite a bit.&quot;</p>\n<p>So the next time you're sitting on a plane, and you look out and see one of those hot guys in the work suit jumpers, you'll know!</p>",
