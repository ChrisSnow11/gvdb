  "description": "Wyatt is a waiter that I met while dining out one evening. He just had the cutest smile and I couldn't resist slipping him my card with a nice big tip!\nWhen he finally called (it was at least a month later), we were talking and he mentioned that he's into boxing as a hobby. So, I asked him to bring his boxing gloves with him to the shoot.\nHe's definitely a cutie \u2014 tall and lean, with a slightly fuzzy chest and smooth ass. I decided to do something different with his video, so I put him in a little jockstrap, had him put on his boxing gloves, and set him out on a little shadow boxing session. I really liked the way the shadows played across his muscles!",
