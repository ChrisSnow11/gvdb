  "description": "Ford enlisted in the Army right out of high school. He did a stint in Iraq and is back waiting for his tour of duty to end.\nI don't usually like to ask the military guys who have been in Iraq about it because most of them think it's pretty fucked up and the whole subject tends to be a downer.\nSo, I asked him, \"You've got kind of an unusual name. Was that from your mother or father?\"\n\"My dad,\" he said. \"He's into cars and shit.\"\n\"How about you -- are you into cars?\"\nHis response: \"Yeah, I like Camaros.\"\n\"But Ford doesn't make Camaros,\" I said jokingly.\nHe smiled and said \"Yeah, I know.\" God, I love military guys. What you see is what you get. And Ford is as military as you can get... right down to the haircut.\n\"What are you going to do after you get out of the military?\" I asked.\n\"I dunno. Probably lay bricks or something.\"\nNow I've said this many times before -- a good meter of a guy's \"straightness\" is how easily he shows his asshole. Straight guys hate showing their assholes.\nWhen the cameras starting rolling we asked Ford to bend over and show his asshole. He did it but was clearly embarrassed. It looked a lot like he was getting a military physical. Maybe that's what it was. If he wasn't used to taking orders in the military he would have probably refused.\n\"That was fucked up,\" he said. Yup, he's straight!",
