  "description": "\"I was so skinny in high school,\" Brady told us. \"I was six feet tall and weighed 130 pounds. It was pretty bad.\"\nThen, when he turned 18, the muscle started to come on.\n\"I don't know what happened,\" he said. \"My dad's pretty muscular, so I guess his genes kicked in.\"\nSo how did it feel to go from a skinny kid to a hot, buff young man?\n\"It was awesome,\" he said. \"All of a sudden the girls were all about it.\"\nEncouraged by his new-found hotness, Brady started hitting the gym pretty hard.\n\"I've been at it for almost three years now,\" he said. \"I'm pretty happy with it!\"",
