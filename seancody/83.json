  "description": "I'm not kidding when I say that for most of my guys it's their first time in front of \"the camera.\" Tobey just turned 18 two months ago and I think that when he did this video he wasn't quite sure what to make of the whole thing.\nHe reminds me a lot of Josh not only because he looks like him but also because he looked to me for a lot of direction (which I don't mind at all <grin>). He's one of those guys who doesn't say much and so I wasn't able to get much out of him in the way of conversation. Oh well, he makes up for it other ways...\nHe does have an adorable face though, and a great cock and swimmer's build. He's a little sunburned because apparently the day before he fell asleep while laying out at the pool.",
