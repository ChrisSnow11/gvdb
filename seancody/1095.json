  "description": "He called me \u201csir\u201d and that was a sure sign that Mack is a good ol\u2019 Southern boy and we all know how fun Southern boys can be. He likes four wheeling, or \u201cmuddin\u2019\u201d as he called it, bull riding, sports and the ranch life in general.\nHe\u2019s had some wild times and has been working in construction but is ready to move on in life and start college.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the dumbest thing you\u2019ve ever done?\u201d\n\u201cI shot a cop car with a paint ball gun,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNo way! Did you go to juvie for that?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI never got caught.\u201d\nI've never done it, but I guess bull riding is good for the body \u2013 Mack is lean, defined and solid. He works his foreskin just right while jerking off to the point where you can see all his muscles flexing.\nAfter tossing a football around at the park and some acrobatics, he opened up a bit more about traveling, life and sex. It\u2019s a sure bet that he\u2019s excited to see the world!",
