  "description": "Enrique is a native of Venezuela. He's a guitar player who came to the United States to be part of a band. Unfortunately, the band didn't get along so he's planning on moving to Europe and needed some extra cash.\nHe doesn't speak English very well. I got a kick out of trying to explain to him what \"cum\" means.\nIf you like your guys skinny, uncut, and Latin, you'll like this one.",
