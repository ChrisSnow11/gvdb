  "description": "Clinton is from the South, and boy, is he from the South!\nI went to pick him up from the airport and he was wearing a cowboy shirt, cowboy boots, and a cowboy hat. I don't think he'd ever flown before because he just seemed so excited about the whole experience.\nWorking with Clinton was a hoot. Some of the things he said just cracked me up (check out the blooper in the interview) and I loved his southern accent.\nHe's got an adorable boyish face, with pale skin, really nice muscles, and a cock with a bit of a curve to it.",
