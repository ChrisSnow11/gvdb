  "description": "<p>Emerson was once banned from a club because he wouldn't stop jumping up and down on the furniture!</p>\n<p>That didn't surprise me at all, because I noticed right away that he has a very cute, energetic personality.</p>\n<p>Emerson is straight but he loves gay people.</p>\n<p>&quot;I have a lot of gay friends,&quot; he said. &quot;Both male and female. I love to hang out with them at the gay bars. They're so much fun!&quot;</p>\n<p>I suspect that he might like the attention he gets there as well!</p>\n<p>He's from a high-elevation midwest town that gets a lot of snow. And, oddly enough, he hates the snow.</p>\n<p>&quot;I ride my bike everywhere,&quot; he told us. &quot;It's a real pain. This year I had to spend extra money on snow tires.&quot;</p>\n<p>Emerson's best feature is definitely his smile. It's very charming!</p>",
