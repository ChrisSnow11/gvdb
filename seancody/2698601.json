  "description": "<p>&quot;I'd like to go into fashion,&quot; Kyle said. &quot;Fashion designer or just anything to do with the fashion industry.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Have you had any experience with that?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;No, not yet.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;What made you want to do it?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Even since I saw my first Abercrombie &amp; Fitch catalog,&quot; he said. &quot;I've always been interested in it. Whether I'm on the red carpet interviewing celebrities to see what they're wearing or if I'm actually making the clothes... it's all good.&quot;</p>\n<p>Kyle's kind of a party boy, and he and his friends like to hit the town.</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah, we can get into some pretty big trouble if we want to,&quot; he said. &quot;When we're together things are pretty wild.&quot;</p>\n<p>Kyle is single, but says he's a romantic.</p>\n<p>&quot;Cards, flowers, nice dinners,&quot; he said. &quot;I like to make a girl happy!&quot;</p>",
