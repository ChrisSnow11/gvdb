  "description": "Otis was willing to do anything with us because he loves trying new things, so we took him rock climbing.\n\n\u201cThis weekend is full of first times!\u201d\n\nWe asked Otis what turns him on. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie, I kind of turn myself on. And if I was ever going to be gay in any way, it would probably be if I could have the opportunity to fuck myself.\u201d He said confidently.\n\n\u201cWould you top or bottom for yourself?\u201d We asked curiously.\n\n\u201cI think I would fight myself for that, knowing my personality.\u201d That personality of his got intense. He definitely wasn\u2019t lying about being into himself. Watching him get turned on by his own reflection was such a treat, especially because his dick was still throbbing after blowing a huge load on the mirror!",
