  "description": "<p>&quot;When did you decide to grow a beard?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;About six months ago,&quot; Reid replied. &quot;I was feeling lazy, didn't feel like shaving for a week... and then I liked it!&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Well, it looks good on you,&quot; I said. &quot;It matches the rest of your body!&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah, I guess,&quot; he said with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>&quot;So,&quot; I asked, &quot;when did you start getting hairy?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Early,&quot; he replied. &quot;It was actually kind of embarrassing at first. In gym class, I'd always be on the 'skins' team somehow.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;You didn't like it?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Well, I had a hairy chest and everyone else had nothing.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said, &quot;I guess as a kid you don't want to be different.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Exactly!&quot;</p>\n<p>Well, his chest hair totally works now. He's got a lean, nicely muscled, swimmer's build and he's pretty hairy!</p>",
