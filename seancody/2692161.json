  "description": "<p>There is a surf spot nearby that is nearly always crawling with surfers. A friend of mine has a house there and we love to sit on his balcony and watch the guys change in and out of their wetsuits, always hoping for the occasional dropped towel.</p>\n<p>One Saturday afternoon we were doing just that and I spotted a guy who was the spitting image of Dylan. I mean, this guy looked more like Dylan than Dylan's own brother!</p>\n<p>As he changed out of his wetsuit, I could see that he had a lean, tight body. So I set my beer down and ran down the stairs and across the street to meet him. As I was talking to him, I noticed how much his demeanor was like Dylan's, especially the Dylan from the early days.</p>\n<p>It turns out that the next day he was leaving town for a surfing competition. Fortunately, he called me the day he got back!</p>",
