  "description": "I can spot a Marine from miles away. It doesn\u2019t matter if they are stationed on the west coast or the east coast, there\u2019s just something about the way they move and behave. The few and the proud all the way. Their pride, training and discipline is evident \u2014 just look take a look at Amos.\nHe sat there with a sweet, shy look on his face, very respectfully answering questions with a slight Southern accent as they were asked. There\u2019s no doubt he\u2019s got a great workout routine down. He\u2019s stuck to it since his first day in boot camp and has found other sports to mix things up a bit. But he\u2019s not all work and no play.\n\u201cDo you have a crazy social life or are you kind of a home body?\u201d\n\u201cI go out, hang out at the bars and stuff,\u201d he responded. \u201c I don\u2019t drink, but I like to party.\u201d\n\u201cDo you consider yourself a little bit of a playboy?\u201d\nHis smile and confidence lit up. \u201cI like to show off.\u201d\nSo I had him show his stuff. His body is muscled all the way down to his toes! Every move he made triggered a flex. He\u2019s been and placed in a few body building competitions. The great thing was that he was humble about it but aware that his efforts were appreciated. It turned him on... which I definitely appreciated. He had a boner popping through his shorts and he was ready to go!",
