  "description": "Quentin is the type of straight guy you might see at the mall. You know, wearing a loose-fitting t-shirt, jeans, and sneakers, with lean hairy arms that make you wonder what the rest of his body looks like. Maybe with a kid or two in tow, and a wife with a sweet face who hangs on his every word.\nWell, that's not exactly Quentin... he's single and he doesn't have any kids, but he does have nice arms!\nAs I got to know Quentin, I discovered that he's a small town farm guy that's both sporty and nerdy!\nHe's got a tight, athletic runner's body, but he also likes his role-playing games.\nBiggest surprise of all... he participated in cage fighting! I've met up with a lot of guys who do this, but never any like Quentin!\n\"I did cage fighting\u2026 I did that for probably two years. Started out because I was afraid of getting punched in the face, getting beat up\u2026 so I jumped in a cage with a 5'6\" farm kid that knew how to box.\"\nInteresting! He's not doing it any longer, which is a good thing, because I would hate to see his handsome face get banged up!",
