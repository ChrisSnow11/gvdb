  "description": "<p>I met Clay about three months ago.  He came in to do some nude photos and I was so impressed with his lean, muscular physique that I immediately wanted him back to do a video. Apparently Clay has sex all the time &#8212; he had just had it the morning of the photo shoot, so I told him to lay off for a day or two and come back later in the week.</p>\n<p>On the day of the video shoot, Clay was nowhere to be found. He didn't show up for his appointment and he wasn't answering his cell phone. I was disappointed, but &quot;no shows&quot; are just something you have deal with sometimes.</p>\n<p>About a week later, a friend of Clay's called and told me Clay had been  in a fight. He was trying to defend a friend and, unfortunately, his (beautiful) face had been bruised up pretty badly.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, this young, hot, straight boy is very resilient. After making a full recovery, Clay called and said he was ready to &quot;rub one off&quot;...</p>",
