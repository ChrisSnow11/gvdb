  "description": "Ron is a BIG guy. Yeah, he has a boyish face, but with all that muscle I guessed he might be a bruiser.\n\u201cHave you ever gotten in a fight before?\u201d I asked. \u201cBecause you seem too nice to be a fighter.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cNever been in a fight, never.\u201d\n\u201cEver?\u201d\n\u201cNever!\u201d\nIt turns out that no one has ever wanted to fight him because he\u2019s just so agreeable (and he\u2019s big).\nHe\u2019s also smart. He\u2019s currently learning two languages to further his career, which keeps him busy.\n\u201cI\u2019m chronically single,\u201d he lamented. \u201cI\u2019m so busy all the time it doesn\u2019t leave room for relationships.\u201d\nThe best thing about Ron is that he\u2019s hot but he doesn\u2019t know it.\n\u201cHow often do you get hit on?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cEvery once in a while,\u201d he said, as if he wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cI think that I may be a little oblivious to it though, so maybe more than I think!\u201d",
