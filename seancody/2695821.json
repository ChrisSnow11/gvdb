  "description": "<p>&quot;I grew up on the beaches of the east coast,&quot; Ken told us. &quot;It was pretty nice!&quot;</p>\n<p>Kent is 23 years old and recently graduated from college. He's moved away from his home town but still retains his cute eastern accent.</p>\n<p>He loves the water &#8212; swimming, surfing, and boogie boarding. He's got a shark tattoo on his shoulder because, as he said, he &quot;loves sharks.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Do you like girls or guys?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;A little bit of both,&quot; he said. &quot;Whatever looks good I like!&quot;</p>\n<p>When asked to elaborate he said, &quot;My experience with guys is pretty limited. I've made out a few times, a little bit of touching, but nothing serious.&quot;</p>\n<p>He has a pretty interesting philosophy on kissing:</p>\n<p>&quot;I've kissed a lot of really good girls,&quot; he said. &quot;I've kissed a few really good guys. It's whatever feels comfortable. Every one has their own technique.&quot;</p>\n<p>Kent is definitely build like a swimmer. Tall and lean with muscular legs. He's got a nice, round ass and low-hanging balls that tighten up just before he dumps his creamy white load!</p>\n<p>P.S.: I'm not sure, but I think he really &quot;liked&quot; our camera guy! </p>",
