  "description": "<p>Broden is 20 years old, a college student studying criminal justice, and a baseball player.</p>\n<p>&quot;Chicks dig baseball players,&quot; he told me.</p>\n<p>Straight guys. It always has to have something to do with chicks.</p>\n<p>&quot;What's your favorite position?&quot; I asked him.</p>\n<p>&quot;Pitching,&quot; he replied.</p>\n<p>&quot;So you're a pitcher, huh?&quot; I said in a teasing way.</p>\n<p>&quot;Yup.&quot;</p>\n<p>Well that one went right over his head. I shouldn't have expected a straight guy to get it anyway.</p>\n<p>Now the very first thing that struck me about Broden was his body hair. He's pretty smooth up top, just a light dusting of hair on his perfectly toned chest. However, his legs are very hairy and his pubic hair is completely wild.</p>\n<p>&quot;That's a pretty big bush you got there,&quot; I teased him. &quot;Your legs are pretty hairy too.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah, I kind of like having the hair. It keeps me warm.&quot;</p>\n<p>Finally. A guy who is comfortable with his hirsuteness. If I had a dollar for every time I've heard &quot;the girls don't like it&quot;... well, that's another story.</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah I'll be glad to see the manscaping craze end,&quot; I said. &quot;So the girls don't mind?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Nah.&quot;</p>\n<p>He doesn't have a girlfriend, but wants to get married someday.</p>\n<p>That will be one lucky girl. I wouldn't mind waking up every morning next to his muscular hairiness!</p>",
