  "description": "<p>Nick is a production assistant so he is used to being around video cameras. He's usually the one going out and grabbing coffee or things that are needed, and that ended up being something he brought with him. During breaks, he would ask if anyone needed anything!</p>\n<p>He has a very boyish face, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that he had some hair on his chest and ass. He started getting hairy when he was 17 and sometimes he got ribbing for it from his brother.</p>\n<p>&quot;You know when you take your clothes off, you actually look a little bigger because you are so defined.&quot; </p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah...it's an illusion,&quot; he joked.</p>\n<p> It's good to know that he's not taking a razor to his body hair. It is definitely sexy &#8212; even more so when it's not expected. </p>",
