  "description": "Jack was raised on a farm with eight brothers and sisters. He's southern, but don\u2019t let the accent and charm fool you. He admits to running around and causing trouble when he was younger.\nHe worked a lot of odd jobs as a teenager, and he used the little amount of money he made snowboarding. He loves snowboarding so much that as soon as he turned 18 he moved north so he could hit the slopes as much as he could.\nFarming and snowboarding have given Jack an awesome body! His legs are very defined and his abs are ripped!\nHe also has some impressive low-hanging balls, which we pointed out as he pulled his shorts off. He was very comfortable with being naked.\nHe pretty much said it all when we asked him, \u201cAre you usually naked in front of strangers?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind it that\u2019s for sure. I feel very comfortable being naked in front of strangers!\u201d",
