  "description": "<p>Enrique is a native of Venezuela. He's a guitar player who came to the United States to be part of a band. Unfortunately, the band didn't get along so he's planning on moving to Europe and needed some extra cash.</p>\n<p>He doesn't speak English very well. I got a kick out of trying to explain to him what &quot;cum&quot; means.</p>\n<p>If you like your guys skinny, uncut, and Latin, you'll like this one.</p>",
