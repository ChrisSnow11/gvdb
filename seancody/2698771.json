  "description": "<p>&quot;I am having the best time right now,&quot; Clint said, referring to his stage in life. &quot;I'm kind of glad I'm not married. I don't know if that's a bad thing to say, but I'm glad I'm not. A wife and kids just isn't what I want...&quot;</p>\n<p>He's 36 now. When he was 18 he went into the military for eight years, and then went back to school after that to get his degree.</p>\n<p>&quot;I work and I have fun,&quot; he said. &quot;I love dating younger women. They're a lot of fun!&quot;</p>\n<p>Clint has one hell of a rocking bod so I don't think it's hard for him to get any girl he wants!</p>\n<p>&quot;When I was growing up I was a skinny kid in Idaho,&quot; he said. &quot;It was pretty boring. The girls didn't show much interest.&quot;</p>\n<p>Clint works out 4 to 5 days a week to keep his physique.</p>\n<p>&quot;Maybe someday I'll settle down,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm just having too much fun now!&quot;</p>",
