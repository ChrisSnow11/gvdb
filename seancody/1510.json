  "description": "\u201cI\u2019m from the midwest,\u201d Jayden said. \u201cEveryone from the midwest is nice!\u201d\nAnd he was right... Jayden was extremely polite the entire time he was here.\n\u201cWill you do anything we ask?\u201d I joked. \u201cIf we ask nicely?\u201d\nHe laughed. I think he knew what I meant.\n\u201cProbably,\u201d he said. \u201cI've always had a problem with saying no!\u201d\nWe were relaxing around the pool and Jayden was wearing next to nothing.\nIt didn\u2019t take much to get him out of his clothes. He has a nice body and you could tell he was proud of it.\n\u201cI work pretty hard on it,\u201d he said bashfully.\nJayden seems pretty open minded, so maybe he really will do anything we ask!",
