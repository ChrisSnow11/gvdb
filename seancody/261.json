  "description": "Drake is a total surfer. I picked him up off the beach right after he had come out of the water. He was totally wet, with his surfboard under one arm. His board shorts clung to his body and I could see his package very clearly!\nAfter a few phone calls, he came in for an interview. Unfortunately, his eye was swollen and bruised from being hit with a surf board the previous day. I had to wait a few weeks for the swelling to go down and I wasn't sure if I would ever see him again. Fortunately, surfers are always in need of money and once he was better he was good to go.\nFor being completely green as a model, Drake actually did very well and seemed very comfortable in front of the camera. He's got a hot, muscular body and one of the cutest smiles I've seen in a while.",
