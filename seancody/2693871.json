  "description": "<p>To be honest, when I first met Brady, I wasn't sure how it was going to work out.</p>\n<p>He has a shaved head and looks like the type that would be at home picking a fight in a bar.  He was wearing a baggy shirt and jeans with black military boots.  So I couldn't really tell what his body looked like.</p>\n<p>&quot;Why don't you go ahead and get undressed,&quot; I requested, not really sure what to expect.</p>\n<p>&quot;All the way?&quot; he asked.  Not the least bit shy.  I liked that.</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah, all the way.&quot;</p>\n<p>First, the boots and socks came off.  I'm not much of a foot person so nothing to see there, really.  Then the shirt came off.</p>\n<p>&quot;Holy shit!&quot; I thought to myself.</p>\n<p>Then the pants and finally the underwear.</p>\n<p>&quot;Man you got a muscular little body on you!&quot; I thought out loud.  And he did.  Very muscular and nicely proportioned.  Cute ass too.</p>\n<p>He smiled and said &quot;Thanks.&quot;</p>\n<p>I was really starting to warm up to this guy.  He wasn't at all what I expected.</p>\n<p>Then the obligatory question: &quot;You straight or gay?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I'm bi,&quot; he replied.</p>\n<p>Shocker.  I would have pegged him for straight.</p>\n<p>I thought for a moment about having him take out the earrings.  Make him a little more &quot;collegiate&quot;.  But I decided against it.  The look works for him.</p>\n<p>Brady was actually a lot of fun to work with.  He's a nasty boy.  I loved how he ejaculated at the end of the movie (and what he did with the result)!</p>",
