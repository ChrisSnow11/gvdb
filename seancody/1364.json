  "description": "\"I love basketball!\"\nI was really surprised when Nestor told me that, because he definitely isn't built for it. He's very muscular, with thick arms and a broad chest. And, at 5'5\" it's definitely a higher jump for him to get to the net.\nAs were out on a nice sunny day, though, he showed me that he's actually pretty good.\nHe was able to free throw perfectly, and his dunks and lay ups were really good, too!\n\"I practice a lot,\" he said. \"I've been playing since I was five.\"\nHe's also into weight lifting, which he's been doing since he was a teenager.\n\"I was a skinny kid,\" he said. \"It took some time to put muscle on!\"",
