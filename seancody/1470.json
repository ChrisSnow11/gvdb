  "description": "\"You have a lot of hair!\"\n\"Yeah I know!\u201d Alexander replied with a laugh. \u201cYou should have seen me as a kid. It was out of control!\u201d\nAlexander is a new arrival to southern California - he\u2019s an east coast transplant. He recently moved here here with his friend, and both of them have started looking for modeling jobs.\n\"Everyone keeps telling me that I should move to LA if I want to make it,\u201d he said, crunching up his nose in an obvious expression of distaste. \u201cBut I really love it here...\"\nHe was eyeing the ocean, and the beach, the sand, and the people. He had his skim board with him and he wanted to show us his skills. Unfortunately, the waves weren\u2019t working in his favor.\n\u201cThe skim is bad today,\u201d he said with a sad little frown.\nThat was the only frown I ever saw on him, though. He\u2019s an incredibly upbeat, charming guy who likes to make other people happy.\n\"When I lived on the east coast, I noticed that a lot of people were just kinda cranky,\u201d he explained. \u201cI moved here hoping that if I surround myself with happy people, maybe I\u2019ll be happier!\u201d",
