  "description": "Heath is a student who likes to practice martial arts. He's straight and has a girlfriend, but might be better classified as \"metrosexual,\" as he is a very stylish dresser.\nWhen I first met him, it was his adorable face and contagious smile that first struck me. When he took off his shirt, I was pleasantly surprised to see his beautiful olive skin and lean, six-pack abs.\nHeath had done some conventional modeling before, but was looking for more, shall we say, lucrative ways of earning money for school.",
