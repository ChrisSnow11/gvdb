  "description": "Zeke is a full-time college student who has had a life-long passion for running. He's shy, but he's also very intelligent. He was a high honors student in high school and is looking to graduate from his university early.\nWith his background I was surprised that he wanted to do a film. I asked him about it and he said he's always led a sheltered life and he wanted to do something wild.\nFor those who like them young, dark, and lean, Zeke is a real treat. He's also got a nice, full bush which I really like!",
