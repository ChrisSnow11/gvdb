  "description": "<p>&quot;This place is like an adult playground!&quot; William said as he was sliding all over the counter he had covered in lube.</p>\n<p>&quot;Wow!&quot; I said, a little surprised. &quot;When I first met you I thought you were the shy, reserved, polite type.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Well that's cause we just met,&quot; he replied. &quot;Wait 'til you get to know me!&quot;</p>\n<p>I think that for William, being reserved around new people came from his military background. But deep down, you could tell there was a little rambunctious kid waiting to get out.</p>\n<p>&quot;Now that you're out of the military, what do you do?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I'm a cattle rancher,&quot; he replied. &quot;We have a pretty big ranch... acres and acres!&quot;</p>\n<p>Now, William has a compact little body, and his cock looks huge against his frame. And while we were filming I noticed that his hairy balls were hanging just as low as his cock.</p>\n<p>&quot;You're pretty furry down there,&quot; I said. &quot;Do you ever shave?&quot;</p>\n<p>Honestly, I was glad that he hadn't recently!</p>\n<p>&quot;Once,&quot; he said. &quot;It was really smooth and it made my cock look huge, but it was just a lot of work. I like things simpler so I keep it all natural.&quot;</p>\n<p>William really enjoyed playing with his balls. During the day he kept pulling on them or fondling them during breaks.</p>\n<p>I was full of questions that day and William wasn't shy, so I asked one more...</p>\n<p>&quot;What's life like with an uncut cock?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Fun!&quot; he said. &quot;There is more sensation. I actually feel bad for guys with a cut dick... it must be boring!&quot;</p>",
