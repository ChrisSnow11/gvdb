  "description": "<p>&quot;I love basketball!&quot;</p>\n<p>I was really surprised when Nestor told me that, because he definitely isn't built for it. He's very muscular, with thick arms and a broad chest. And, at 5'5&quot; it's definitely a higher jump for him to get to the net.</p>\n<p>As were out on a nice sunny day, though, he showed me that he's actually pretty good.</p>\n<p>He was able to free throw perfectly, and his dunks and lay ups were really good, too!</p>\n<p>&quot;I practice a lot,&quot; he said. &quot;I've been playing since I was five.&quot;</p>\n<p>He's also into weight lifting, which he's been doing since he was a teenager.</p>\n<p>&quot;I was a skinny kid,&quot; he said. &quot;It took some time to put muscle on!&quot;</p>",
