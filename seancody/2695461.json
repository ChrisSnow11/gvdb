  "description": "<p>Dakota is a 20-year-old college student. He was on the football and wrestling teams in high school and is now wrestling on the college level.</p>\n<p>He had a lot of interesting stories about those sexy little singlets that the guys have to wear (which I've always found to be very homo-erotic). But the most interesting information he had to convey was about two wrestling moves that I'd never heard of: the &quot;butt drag&quot; and the &quot;oil check.&quot;</p>\n<p>The &quot;butt drag&quot; is when one of the guys applies pressure to or rubs his hand against his opponent's rectal region. The &quot;oil check&quot; is when he actually sticks a finger up his opponent's asshole!</p>\n<p>Both moves are intended to distract one's opponent &#8212; which I'm sure they would!  </p>\n<p>I didn't believe him, but a little Googling after the fact revealed that he was telling the truth. Now I'm wondering if all those hot Mormon wrestlers I went to school with were checking each other's oil!</p>\n<p>Anyway, Dakota says he's straight, but added a &quot;<em><strong>but</strong></em>&quot;...</p>\n<p>&quot;I've experimented with guys before,&quot; he said. &quot;In college.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I've been played with a little bit by another guy,&quot; he said. &quot;And I've played with guys a little bit myself.&quot;</p>\n<p>When I pressed him on what he meant by &quot;played with&quot; he said, &quot;Blowjobs, mostly.&quot;</p>\n<p>So, he's straight but curious!       </p>",
