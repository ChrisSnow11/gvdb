  "description": "Frank is an eighteen-year-old jock who likes to play football. A recent high school graduate, he's enjoying the freedom of being on his own \u2014 which, for young straight guys, means chasing girls. He was working as a waiter at a local restaurant when I spotted him, and he later told me that being a waiter is one of the best ways to pick up on women. He said he especially loves it when an \"older\" (which to him means \"over 30\") woman leaves her number with the check.",
