  "description": "Kirk is a midwestern boy that grew up, truly, as country as it gets.\n\u201cI love to hunt,\u201d he told us. \u201cI got my first BB gun when I was five.\u201d\n\u201cWhat's the craziest thing you've ever shot?\u201d\n\u201cSquirrels!\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cSquirrel meat is great. It\u2019s chewy.\u201d\nWhat do you do when an adorable boy tells you in a southern twang that he shoots rodents? I just laughed.\nKirk is currently working as a server to help feed his constant need to tour the world.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to Rome, Paris, London...\u201d The list went on and on. But he seemed extra excited to be in California.\n\u201cWhen we are done here I kinda wanna go learn to surf,\u201d he said. \u201c...or see the zoo.\u201d\nKirk also has a soft side, and he\u2019s not afraid to admit it.\n\u201cI love making romantic home-made dinners,\u201d he admitted.\nKirk was really fun to be around and he had a natural smile that was contagious.\n\u201cYou look really happy,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYup!\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cCause I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be having this much fun!\u201d",
