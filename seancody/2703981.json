  "description": "<p>Coleman is the kind of guy who is a straight-A student, athlete, and the type most likely to be voted \u201cmost popular.\u201d He\u2019s got a charming personality, a killer smile, and one of the most amazing asses I\u2019ve ever seen!</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I was in high school I was the quarterback,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, look!\u201d</p>\n<p>He pulled out his phone and showed us a picture of him in full gear.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you have a hard time fitting into the spandex pants,\u201d I asked. \u201cWith your bubble butt?\u201d</p>\n<p>He laughed. \u201cI guess so,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was probably how people knew it was me. Forget about my jersey number!\u201d</p>\n<p>Coleman was born and raised in southern California. He did a lot surfing when he was growing up.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy hair was really long,\u201d he said. \u201cI got it cut off a year or so back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look more like a Ken doll now!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cSome people say I look like more like a Senator now!\u201d</p>",
