  "description": "<p>I can spot a Marine from miles away. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they are stationed on the west coast or the east coast, there&rsquo;s just something about the way they move and behave. The few and the proud all the way. Their pride, training and discipline is evident &#8212; just look take a look at Amos.</p>\n<p>He sat there with a sweet, shy look on his face, very respectfully answering questions with a slight Southern accent as they were asked. There&rsquo;s no doubt he&rsquo;s got a great workout routine down. He&rsquo;s stuck to it since his first day in boot camp and has found other sports to mix things up a bit. But he&rsquo;s not all work and no play.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Do you have a crazy social life or are you kind of a home body?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I go out, hang out at the bars and stuff,&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo; I don&rsquo;t drink, but I like to party.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Do you consider yourself a little bit of a playboy?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>His smile and confidence lit up. &ldquo;I like to show off.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So I had him show his stuff. His body is muscled all the way down to his toes! Every move he made triggered a flex. He&rsquo;s been and placed in a few body building competitions. The great thing was that he was humble about it but aware that his efforts were appreciated. It turned him on... which I definitely appreciated. He had a boner popping through his shorts and he was ready to go! </p>",
