  "description": "Doug has had an adventurous life so far. A few years ago he was attacked by a shark while swimming in the ocean at night. It left a scar under his right arm, which I noticed when I first met him. When I asked him what happened, I was surprised at now nonchalantly he related the story, like it was just an everyday occurrence.\nThat's the kind of personality that Doug has \u2014 very laid back and not easily shaken. He's very, very straight and most straight guys are nervous about getting naked in front of another guy. Not Doug though... he didn't even pause for a moment when I asked him to drop his drawers!",
