  "description": "I thought Nicolas was adorable from the moment I met him. He\u2019s from South America and he speaks broken English, with lots of funny stories. He was pretty much an open book!\n\u201cI\u2019m half Brazilian, half Colombian,\u201d he told us.\n\u201cWhich half do you think you take after most?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cBrazilian,\u201d he said. \u201cDefinitely Brazilian. I love soccer. I love to cook. I love Brazilian food.\u201d\nHe told us that his girlfriend is Brazilian, and that he used his ability to cook to impress her when they first met.\n\u201cMy mom, she wanted a girl,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut she didn\u2019t have no girls... So she taught me how to cook!\u201d\n\u201cThat must come in handy!\u201d\n\u201cYes it does,\u201d he said. \u201cBonus points!\u201d",
