  "description": "<p>Jim is a surfer who works part time as a waiter. A girlfriend of mine was at the beach and ran into him. He was hanging out by himself (probably girl watching), so she approached him and struck up a conversation.</p>\n<p>After talking for a few minutes, she broached the subject of nude modeling. Jim wasn't shy at all and thought showing off his body for some extra money was a great idea.</p>\n<p>On the day of the shoot, Jim was really nervous. I had him pump some iron to work off the extra energy and get him relaxed a little. In the beginning he kept cracking up, but soon enough his pants were off and he was working his way to a big, powerful load...</p>",
