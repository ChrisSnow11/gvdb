  "description": "\"I like to fight. I like to do MMA.\"\nWe weren't really sure what Colin was talking about. This assumption was that the last 'M' and 'A' stood for 'Marial Arts.'\"\n\"It's mixed martial arts,\" he explained. \"It incorporated all types of fighting. It's basically street fighting with a brain.\"\nHe does it competitively and says that he's had his share of black eyes.\nHis future plans: to become a fire fighter.\n\"Saving lives,\" he said. \"And kicking down doors!\"",
