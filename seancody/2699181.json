  "description": "<p>&quot;I'm from the east coast,&quot; Mitchell told us.</p>\n<p>That was pretty obvious from the moment I met him. He has a very distinctive accent that tells you exactly where he is from!</p>\n<p>&quot;When you're away from home, do people comment on your accent?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't really notice it because I'm around it all the time. I have a lot of friends with accents worse than mine!&quot;</p>\n<p>Mitchell is studying to become a graphic designer.</p>\n<p>&quot;Id' like to do something with the Internet,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>Mitchell is also really, really friendly.</p>\n<p>&quot;I love being social. I'm an optimist and you'll rarely find me in a bad mood...&quot;</p>\n<p>I noticed while we were filming that Mitchell stuck his fingers in his ass a couple of times. After we were done, I asked him about it.</p>\n<p>&quot;I like it,&quot; he said. &quot;It feels really good.&quot;</p>\n<p>That made me wonder, so I asked him, &quot;Are you straight or gay?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I'm bi,&quot; he said. &quot;I usually go for girls, but occasionally I like to get fucked too!&quot;</p>",
