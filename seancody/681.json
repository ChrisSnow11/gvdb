  "description": "\"I grew up on the beaches of the east coast,\" Ken told us. \"It was pretty nice!\"\nKent is 23 years old and recently graduated from college. He's moved away from his home town but still retains his cute eastern accent.\nHe loves the water \u2014 swimming, surfing, and boogie boarding. He's got a shark tattoo on his shoulder because, as he said, he \"loves sharks.\"\n\"Do you like girls or guys?\"\n\"A little bit of both,\" he said. \"Whatever looks good I like!\"\nWhen asked to elaborate he said, \"My experience with guys is pretty limited. I've made out a few times, a little bit of touching, but nothing serious.\"\nHe has a pretty interesting philosophy on kissing:\n\"I've kissed a lot of really good girls,\" he said. \"I've kissed a few really good guys. It's whatever feels comfortable. Every one has their own technique.\"\nKent is definitely build like a swimmer. Tall and lean with muscular legs. He's got a nice, round ass and low-hanging balls that tighten up just before he dumps his creamy white load!\nP.S.: I'm not sure, but I think he really \"liked\" our camera guy!",
