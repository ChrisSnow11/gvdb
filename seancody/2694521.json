  "description": "<p>Bernie is an 18-year-old straight guy from the midwest who describes himself as a &quot;really chill person.&quot;</p>\n<p>He just graduated from high school and is studying to become an electrician because he heard that's where the money is.</p>\n<p>The one thing that really makes his eyes light up is when he talks about his girlfriend of two years.</p>\n<p>&quot;She was kind of a goody-goody before she met me,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>&quot;Did you corrupt her?&quot; I asked.</p>\n<p>&quot;Kind of. But she still listens to her parents and gets really good grades.&quot;</p>\n<p>Then I asked him about the tattoo on his torso.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's Hawaiian for 'family',&quot; he said. &quot;Family means a lot to me.&quot;</p>",
