  "description": "\u201cI grew up in a house with five kids, all boys,\u201d Ken told us. \u201cWe fought all the time when we were kids, but now we\u2019re really close.\u201d\nKen is a college student who really likes basketball.\n\u201cMy brothers taught me how to play when I was really young,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been hooked ever since.\u201d\nIt\u2019s only been a little over a year since he left home to go to school.\n\u201cThe adjustment was kind of hard at first,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now I\u2019m like... ready for adventure!\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t surprise me at all, because Ken was enthusiastic from the moment I met him.\n\u201cThere was a lot of variety in my house growing up. My mother is Japanese and my father is Italian, so there was always a lot from both worlds!\u201d",
