  "description": "Pierce recently got out of the Marines. He had done his four year stint and decided it was time for something new.\n\"It was the best and worst time of my life,\" he said.\n\"Did people know you were gay when you were in there?\"\n\"A couple did, yes,\" he said.\nHe had already told us he is gay... bisexual, actually. He said he is still seeing girls here and there, but...\n\"More guys than girls, probably,\" he confessed.\n\"What do you like more about guys than girls?\"\n\"They're easy to read,\" he said. \"Easy to please. We think on the same level.\"\nHe knows what he wants!\nWe had him soap up in the shower and he told us about his gym locker room fantasy \u2014 meeting a hot guy in the shower and getting \"rough!\"",
