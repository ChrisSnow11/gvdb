  "description": "\"I am having the best time right now,\" Clint said, referring to his stage in life. \"I'm kind of glad I'm not married. I don't know if that's a bad thing to say, but I'm glad I'm not. A wife and kids just isn't what I want...\"\nHe's 36 now. When he was 18 he went into the military for eight years, and then went back to school after that to get his degree.\n\"I work and I have fun,\" he said. \"I love dating younger women. They're a lot of fun!\"\nClint has one hell of a rocking bod so I don't think it's hard for him to get any girl he wants!\n\"When I was growing up I was a skinny kid in Idaho,\" he said. \"It was pretty boring. The girls didn't show much interest.\"\nClint works out 4 to 5 days a week to keep his physique.\n\"Maybe someday I'll settle down,\" he said. \"I'm just having too much fun now!\"",
