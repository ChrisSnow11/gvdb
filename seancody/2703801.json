  "description": "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve skipped a rock in years,\u201d Deron said, his eyes wide like a child\u2019s. \u201cThis is great!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look like you would be a great swimmer with all those back muscles,\u201d I said, laughing as he barely escaped an aggressive wave.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I was a lifeguard when I was younger,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou know, just saving some lives... it was an interesting job.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes moms and dads would break the rules while I was on duty,\u201d he explained. \u201cI had to yell at them more than I yelled at the kids!\u201d</p>\n<p>One thing was for sure, though... Deron loved to show off his body for the camera!</p>\n<p>\u201cI work hard for this!\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m aspiring to be a bodybuilder, to show off this wide back!\u201d</p>\n<p>He does have an amazing, muscular back, and a beefy chest! And he\u2019s definitely a happy guy who loves to have fun.</p>\n<p>\u201cI keep getting myself in awkward situations,\u201d he said. \u201cMy friend recorded a video of me running around wearing a bikini. I got so much shit for it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you fit your junk into a bikini?\u201d I asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy!\u201d he said.</p>",
