  "description": "<p>Ford enlisted in the Army right out of high school.  He did a stint in Iraq and is back waiting for his tour of duty to end.</p>\n<p>I don't usually like to ask the military guys who have been in Iraq about it because most of them think it's pretty fucked up and the whole subject tends to be a downer.</p>\n<p>So, I asked him, &quot;You've got kind of an unusual name.  Was that from your mother or father?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;My dad,&quot; he said.  &quot;He's into cars and shit.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;How about you -- are you into cars?&quot;</p>\n<p>His response: &quot;Yeah, I like Camaros.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;But Ford doesn't make Camaros,&quot; I said jokingly.</p>\n<p>He smiled and said &quot;Yeah, I know.&quot;  God, I love military guys.  What you see is what you get.  And Ford is as military as you can get... right down to the haircut.</p>\n<p>&quot;What are you going to do after you get out of the military?&quot; I asked.</p>\n<p>&quot;I dunno.  Probably lay bricks or something.&quot;</p>\n<p>Now I've said this many times before -- a good meter of a guy's &quot;straightness&quot; is how easily he shows his asshole.  Straight guys hate showing their assholes.</p>\n<p>When the cameras starting rolling we asked Ford to bend over and show his asshole.  He did it but was clearly embarrassed.  It looked a lot like he was getting a military physical.  Maybe that's what it was.  If he wasn't used to taking orders in the military he would have probably refused.</p>\n<p>&quot;That was fucked up,&quot; he said.  Yup, he's straight!</p>",
