  "description": "Coby is a corn-fed boy from the midwest. Ultra popular in high school, he held the prestigious positions of both captain of the football team and homecoming king. In his interview he talks about how he had seven dates to his senior prom.\nI was a bookworm in high school, so I could never relate to guys like Coby. Back then I certainly wouldn't ever have dared asking the kinds of questions I get to ask now. So, needless to say, I had a fun time with this one \u2014 watching the high school jock spread his ass wide open while dumping a hot load is always a good time!",
