  "description": "Duncan is a fitness trainer for a midwest franchise of a popular gym.\nHe said he loves his job, except for one thing:\n\"Sometimes clients don't listen,\" he said. \"It's my job to help them achieve goals... and sometimes they don't listen.\"\nWell, if he's telling them to eat skinless chicken breasts and broccoli all the time, I can certainly understand!\n\"I love working there though,\" he said. \"It's a great way to meet new people.\"\nDuncan is 25 and he's been training for about four years.\n\"I'd like to start my own gym someday,\" he said. \"That's probably a ways off, though.\"\nThe thing that struck me most about Duncan was his eyelashes. They're long and make his blue eyes stand out.\nHe also has a smooth, lean body... I bet he looks good in his uniform!",
