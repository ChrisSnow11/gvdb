  "description": "<p>When I first met Adam, the first thing I noticed was that he bears a striking resemblance to Jon-Erik Hexum, a gorgeous model/actor from the 1980s.</p>\n<p>I mentioned this to Adam, and when he said &quot;who?&quot; I knew I had thoroughly dated myself, so I changed the subject.</p>\n<p>The thing about Adam is he is very sweet and very personable. Plus, he has one of the nicest asses I have ever seen.</p>\n<p>Adam actually did two movies for me. In the first one, he was a little scruffy so I asked him to shave. He did a second one, but I think he looks good no matter what... so I put segments of both shoots into this movie (including both cum shots).</p>",
