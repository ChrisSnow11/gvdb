  "description": "Initially, Jordan comes across as a \"tough\" guy. After all, he is a very solid, muscled, 6-foot-tall young man with a full-force, baseball-trained arm. But that persona quickly fades when he smiles and you start talking to him.\n\"How often do you work out?\"\n\"Four days a week.\"\n\"Is this something you have always done? Or did you just start doing it recently?\" I asked.\n\"Probably about last year... when I was in high school, I worked out a little bit with sports but nothing too much.\"\n\"Do you do personal training... do you have a personal trainer?\"\n\"I just did it by myself, looked online and voil\u00e0!\" he laughed.",
