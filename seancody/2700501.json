  "description": "<p>Alek is originally from Eastern Europe and he moved to the United States about ten years ago. He loves it here but admits to really missing football &#8212; or what we in America call soccer. He&rsquo;s joined local soccer camps and school teams, but he says it&rsquo;s just not the same the same &#8212; according to him, Europeans have a passion for (anything related to) soccer that is 100 times more than Americans have for football.</p>\n<p>He wanted to know if we had soccer fields or where they might be playing some matches. So we went to the park to see him in action. He wasn&rsquo;t kidding about his passion for the sport. He&rsquo;s a monster on the field and for a tall guy (6&rsquo;5&rdquo;)  he&rsquo;s quick. And, like any good soccer player, he hit some phenomenal headers. One hit his head so hard I thought he was going to give himself a concussion. When I asked him if it hurt, his response was, &ldquo;It always feels good!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Even in clothes, you can tell Alek is athletic. Once the clothes come off, you see he's built &#8212; lean and defined with thick, muscular legs and a round, hairy bubble ass. There&rsquo;s a cool confidence about him that&rsquo;s infectious, like he&rsquo;s always on top of the world. But, he&rsquo;s also a jokester who prides himself on being somewhat of a cheese-ball. It&rsquo;s nice that he doesn&rsquo;t take himself so seriously. </p>\n<p>Alek is uncut and he&rsquo;s got some serious foreskin, which he says makes masturbating extra pleasurable!</p>",
