  "description": "\u201cDo you think the neighbors ever wonder what's going on over here?\u201d Erik asked, looking nervously behind him.\n\u201cI doubt it, we\u2019re pretty far away!\u201d\n\u201cIf I was over there I would have my own set of binoculars!\u201d\nErik was all smiles as he stood at the edge of the pool telling us all about his personal life and adventures.\n\n\u201cI have some bisexual tendencies,\u201d he said, looking downward just enough to avoid eye contact.\n\u201cAh, so that\u2019s why you\u2019d be watching.\u201d\n\u201cOf course! I\u2019m not gonna miss the chance to spy on some good looking guys!\u201d\n\u201cSo when you do get a guy, what do you like?\u201d\n\u201cI like to let go and give him control!\u201d he said. \u201cI like the idea of being dominated. For him to maybe even tie my hands up and do whatever he wants to me! Just take it!\u201d\nThat really had my attention. There is something so interesting about a seemingly innocent guy having a dirty side!\n\u201cOne time I was at a gym,\u201d he continued. \u201cI spied a hot guy and we kinda flirted. Next thing I know I was on my knees giving him head in the shower!\u201d\n\u201cDo you still talk to this guy? Or was it like a fling?\u201d\n\u201cNope. Afterwards we kinda smiled and it was over. He was so fucking hot!\u201d\nA little bit of horse play ended with him in the pool... shorts, belt and all! He didn\u2019t seem to mind, though, as he splashed around in the water. I think he was just happy to cool off from the heat. He was a little flirty when he climbed out...\n\u201cLooks like I missed my chance into tricking you into giving me some CPR,\u201d he said, all wet.\nHe\u2019s definitely an adorable guy, with a charming accent and a little bit of man fur!",
