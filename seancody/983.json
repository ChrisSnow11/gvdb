  "description": "The day that we filmed Brendan and Alan it was raining like a mother fucker. Literally, rivers running down the street. We didn't know if we were going to be able to pull it off because the wind was howling and the rain was pounding on the roof and against the windows.\nOnce we got to the house, we did a quick sound check and were able to make some adjustments so the pounding rain wouldn't drown out the hot sex!\nInterestingly, the rain seemed to have an interesting side effect. While we were busy setting up, Brendan and Alan were on the sofa, watching us, and rubbing each others arms, necks, and legs! I've heard that rain can be romantic, or maybe the guys were just horny!\nAt any rate, both of them seemed WAY into each other, especially Brendan. He kept looking at Alan with that \"fuck me\" look, which I thought was super hot!\nThe rain didn't lighten up, but the boys seemed to forget about it as Alan plowed the hell out of Brendan.\nAt the end, Alan gave Brendan one of the best, most powerful facials I've ever seen!",
