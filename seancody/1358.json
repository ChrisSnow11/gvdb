  "description": "Emerson was once banned from a club because he wouldn't stop jumping up and down on the furniture!\nThat didn't surprise me at all, because I noticed right away that he has a very cute, energetic personality.\nEmerson is straight but he loves gay people.\n\"I have a lot of gay friends,\" he said. \"Both male and female. I love to hang out with them at the gay bars. They're so much fun!\"\nI suspect that he might like the attention he gets there as well!\nHe's from a high-elevation midwest town that gets a lot of snow. And, oddly enough, he hates the snow.\n\"I ride my bike everywhere,\" he told us. \"It's a real pain. This year I had to spend extra money on snow tires.\"\nEmerson's best feature is definitely his smile. It's very charming!",
