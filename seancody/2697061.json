  "description": "<p>&quot;I like girls,&quot; AJ said. &quot;Only.&quot;</p>\n<p>I have to admit I was surprised by his comment. When I first met him I thought he might be gay. I don't know why, really. Maybe it's just a &quot;metrosexual&quot; vibe he puts off.</p>\n<p>AJ is 24, 6'3&quot; tall, 170 pounds, and he has a 12 1/2 shoe size.</p>\n<p>He's also got a lean, cut body with some clippered chest hair.</p>\n<p>He's from the south, and he he has seven siblings, five of which are brothers.</p>\n<p>&quot;We're all kind of built the same,&quot; he same. &quot;Lean builds run in the family.&quot;</p>\n<p>All of his brothers and sisters are married, which leaves him the only single one. </p>\n<p> &quot;I'm definitely the wildest!&quot; he said... </p>",
