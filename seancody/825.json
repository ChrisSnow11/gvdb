  "description": "\"I'm a shy person,\" Martin said. \"I'm usually pretty quiet.\"\nThat was true, but it wasn't a surprise. When I first met Martin I could tell by his puppy-dog eyes and the way he would only cautiously make eye contact that he was kind of a wall flower.\nThis kind of intrigued me because sometimes I mistakenly assume that just because someone is hot that they are outgoing.\n\"I usually wait for people to talk to me,\" he explained. \"I'm not sure why. I've just always been that way.\"\nMartin classifies himself as \"bi-curious,\" but he's never done anything with another guy. So maybe we'll see!",
