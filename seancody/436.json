  "description": "Wow, did I have a lot of fun filming Judd! He looks like a corn-fed midwestern boy, but his east coast accent gives away his Italian/New York background.\nI think he kind of has a \"superhero\" quality to him... put him in some tights and a cape and I think you'd have a darn good Superman on your hands. The dark curly hair, the piercing blue eyes, and the killer body are all there.\nJudd loves getting attention. We took him out to the beach and even though there were other hot guys there wearing next to nothing, all eyes were on Judd!\nHe's straight and seeing a girl or two, but nothing serious yet...",
