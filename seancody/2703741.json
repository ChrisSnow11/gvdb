  "description": "<p>At first glance, Leon comes across as kind of a hard ass. But once he speaks and smiles you realize you can\u2019t judge a book by its cover. </p>\n<p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m a bit of a flirt,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst I reel them in with my smile, bait them with my charming personality, and then finish them off with a little bit of French. Works every time!\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s fluent in French and he likes to use that to his advantage.</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes I make up random things and say them in French. They may think I\u2019m whispering sweet nothings, but usually I\u2019m just spewing random crap!\u201d</p>\n<p>Leon is only 18 years old, and surprisingly, he just graduated from high school. In the last year he\u2019s really buffed up. He\u2019s very proud of his body and doesn\u2019t mind showing it off.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve just recently started doing body builder competitions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s that going for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s kind hilarious wearing those \u2018banana hammocks\u2019 on stage! Just letting your junk hang out for all to see... it\u2019s exciting.\u201d</p>\n<p>His \u2018junk\u2019 is really nice too... thick and uncut.</p>\n<p>\u201cI used to wish I was cut when I was younger,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you still wish that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHell no! Lose all that sensation. No way!\u201d</p>",
