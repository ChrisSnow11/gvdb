  "description": "<p>Tad arrived on a Monday afternoon. I'd only spoken with him on the phone, but he seemed like a nice guy.</p>\n<p> It just so happens that a  female friend of mine was visiting for the week. She loves to meet new people and thought it would be fun to take one of my models out for dinner and drinks.</p>\n<p>We went to pick up Tad and within minutes of arriving my friend was all over him, asking him all kinds of questions. I can only imagine what he was thinking! He's really quiet and shy.</p>\n<p>My friend  thinks Tad looks a lot like Justin Timerberlake. Maybe just a little... </p>",
