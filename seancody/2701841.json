  "description": "<p>Initially, Jordan  comes across as a &quot;tough&quot; guy. After all, he is a very solid, muscled, 6-foot-tall young man with a full-force, baseball-trained arm. But that persona quickly fades when he smiles and you start talking to him.</p>\n<p>&quot;How often do you work out?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Four days a week.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Is this something you have always done? Or did you just start doing it recently?&quot; I asked.</p>\n<p>&quot;Probably about last year... when I was in high school, I worked out a little bit with sports but nothing too much.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Do you do personal training... do you have a personal trainer?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I just did it by myself, looked online and voil\u00e0!&quot; he laughed.",
