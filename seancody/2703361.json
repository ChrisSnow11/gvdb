  "description": "<p>&quot;I started gymnastics when I was 2 and I did it 'til I was about 18,&quot;  Eric explained as we were leaving the beach. &quot;So, it was like 16 years in the making.&quot;</p>\n<p>He had been like a kid in a candy store, running all over the sand, doing cartwheels in the waves, wearing loose running shorts that let his balls flop out.</p>\n<p>&quot;What did you do specifically?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Well, I did all around,&quot; he explained. &quot;I did every event but I was really good at floor and vault... Something about my legs, they generate some power!&quot;</p>\n<p>I could tell that Eric had a little bit of a wild streak in him.</p>\n<p>He's an avid gamer, and quite competitive. He also likes graffiti...</p>\n<p>&quot;I do  a lot of artwork, I like painting a lot...&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;What medium?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Usually spray paint on canvas,&quot; he said sheepishly. &quot;I like buying canvas and just tagging up canvas cause then you don't get arrested and stuff like that!&quot;</p>\n<p>Well, at least he knows how to channel it!</p>",
