  "description": "Wilson is a big guy, walking into the studio I was a little intimidated \u201cHow tall are you?\u201d I asked \u201c6\u201d2\u201d. He replied. Wilson is a beefy looking solo with big ole heart of gold and a guy who likes to wear his heart on his sleeve. \u201cMy ex used to call me a big ole teddy bear!\u201d He laughed \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always just been the emotional type. I like to watch movies, buy flowers, and make love. You know how treat people right. Wilson started off a bit shy, but once the cameras got rolling he opened up a bit and really got into it. \u201cWill we ever see you back?\u201d I was praying for a yes. \u201cI doubt it, but who knows.\u201d He winked.",
