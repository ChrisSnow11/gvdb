  "description": "<p>Lewis is 25 years old and has been a DJ for about six years.</p>\n<p>&quot;I love the camaraderie,&quot; he told us. &quot;I love the beautiful people I get to DJ for, I love the party mode, the party scene, and I love when I've got a crowd of a thousand people just yelling and screaming for the music that I play!&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Do you get a lot of play as a DJ?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Umm... every now and then,&quot; he said. &quot;I try not to take too much advantage of it, but the people I take home... definitely some hot looking people!&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;People &#8212; as in guys or girls?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Mainly the girls, absolutely.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;So, a guy every once in a while?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah, maybe... Not very often, but when I see a guy that I like I'm going to let him know!&quot;</p>",
