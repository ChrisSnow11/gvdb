  "description": "<p>&quot;I was so skinny in high school,&quot; Brady told us. &quot;I was six feet tall and weighed 130 pounds. It was pretty bad.&quot;</p>\n<p>Then, when he turned 18, the muscle started to come on.</p>\n<p>&quot;I don't know what happened,&quot; he said. &quot;My dad's pretty muscular, so I guess his genes kicked in.&quot;</p>\n<p>So how did it feel to go from a skinny kid to a hot, buff young man?</p>\n<p>&quot;It was awesome,&quot; he said. &quot;All of a sudden the girls were all about it.&quot;</p>\n<p>Encouraged by his new-found hotness, Brady started hitting the gym pretty hard.</p>\n<p>&quot;I've been at it for almost three years now,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm pretty happy with it!&quot;</p>",
