  "description": "<p>I thought Nicolas was adorable from the moment I met him. He\u2019s from South America and he speaks broken English, with lots of funny stories. He was pretty much an open book!</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m half Brazilian, half Colombian,\u201d he told us.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich half do you think you take after most?\u201d I asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cBrazilian,\u201d he said. \u201cDefinitely Brazilian. I love soccer. I love to cook. I love Brazilian food.\u201d</p>\n<p>He told us that his girlfriend is Brazilian, and that he used his ability to cook to impress her when they first met.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mom, she wanted a girl,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut she didn\u2019t have no girls... So she taught me how to cook!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat must come in handy!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes it does,\u201d he said. \u201cBonus points!\u201d</p>",
