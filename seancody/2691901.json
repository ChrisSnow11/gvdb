  "description": "<p>When I found Thor, he had been showing off for some girls skating on the beach boardwalk. Not being used to concrete that had a dusting of sand, he had taken a dive and had some bad scrapes. He was only here visiting friends for a few weeks, but fortunately there was enough time to let his wounds heal before the cameras came on.</p>\n<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have pegged Thor as a skater since he lives in a conservative town on the east coast. He&rsquo;s someone I could see running for public office one day &#8212; he's got the hair for it, at least! In fact, he kind of looks like a Russian version of the late John F. Kennedy, Jr.</p>\n<p>After he shot his first load, I had him show off some of his boarding moves. Fortunately for us, this time he didn&rsquo;t hurt himself!</p>",
