  "description": "It's a personal preference, but I'm not crazy about tattoos. I've always thought that they are akin to defacing a great work of art. I usually won't use a potential model who has a lot of tattoos unless they have other, um, attributes (such as nice muscles or a big dick).\nWell, that's how I felt about Ramon. His tattoos are rather large, but he has the build of a Greek god and I definitely wanted to see him in action. He's been lifting for about a year now and he's really put on some muscle.",
