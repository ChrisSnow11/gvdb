  "description": "<p>It was difficult not to smile and have a good time around Karl. In fact, we actually spent a lot of time together at the beach.</p>\n<p>&quot;So you and I got to play on the beach today!&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;We did,&quot; he replied with a huge smile.</p>\n<p>&quot;Best part about living on the beach is that you actually get to walk around and see all the surfers\u2026 what part of them turned you on the most?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Their hair and their legs!&quot;</p>\n<p>Karl said he's been a fan of the site for about six years. And, he definitely has his favorites! One in particular was the bearded version of Ethan.</p>\n<p>He's an admitted admirer of all things men, especially legs and body hair. It was clear to me that Karl really likes a man who is a bit scruffy, masculine, and hung enough to give him a great fuck.</p>\n<p>But that was just a little of what I got to know about Karl. He's also a professional chef who enjoys entertaining and spending time with his dog (a half pit bull /  Rhodesian ridgeback). Apparently he lets his dog &quot;walk all over him&quot; &#8212; so much so that he got his dog's paw prints tattooed on his chest as a sign of how much his dog means to him!</p>",
