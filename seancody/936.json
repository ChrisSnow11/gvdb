  "description": "Joseph is 19 and wants to open a dance club.\n\"You'd be too young to even go into your own place,\" I joked with him. \"If you served alcohol, that is.\"\n\"I'm in college now,\" he said. \"So that's still a few years out anyways.\"\nHe's not in a hurry to finish college, and says his priorities right now are \"skating and partying.\"\nHe has a girlfriend, but isn't keen on being in a relationship.\n\"Yeah, you gotta steer clear of those,\" he said. I wasn't sure if he meant a girlfriend or a relationship.\nAnd then he clarified: \"Girls always gotta know where you're at, always gotta know what you're doing...\"\n\"So you're kind of a free spirit. You don't like to be monitored?\"\n\"No, I'm just trying to do my own thing...\"\nI suggested (half jokingly) that he might want to give guys a try.\n\"If you find the right guy, you could get your rocks off and still do your own thing.\"\n\"Hmmm...\" he said. \"I hadn't thought of that.\"",
