  "description": "\u201cI don\u2019t pretend to be someone I\u2019m not,\u201d Jay said. \u201cI like being gay... it\u2019s more fun and you\u2019re able to get away with a lot more!\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d I said. I liked this guy already.\n\u201cYeah... It\u2019s really interesting\u2026somehow everything we do ends up looking a lot more adorable than if a straight guy did it!\"\nOne thing I noticed about Jay right away is that he has a lot of confidence. He has a hot, muscular body but I think his attitude is way more sexy!\n\u201cI\u2019ve always known that I was gay,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember knowing at a very young age.\u201d\nJay is a gymnast, something he\u2019s been doing since he was a kid. He\u2019s actually pretty good and he competed at the collegiate level.\n\u201cI love doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it can be distracting!\u201d\n\u201cHow so?\u201d\n\u201cThose boys are hot!\u201d\nI had a good day with Jay. He really made me laugh!",
