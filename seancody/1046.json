  "description": "Russ is an Air Force vet who\u2019s well mannered, genuine, and really nice. Now, he\u2019s in college and devoted full-time to his studies. Russ is ambitious and, one day, wants to be a chef. He also wears his heart on sleeve and admits that may be a reason he\u2019s perpetually single. For Russ though, a relationship isn\u2019t high on his priority list. He\u2019s focused on his studies but likes to casually date\u2026just as long as the girl doesn\u2019t get on his nerves.\n\u201cWhat annoys you most about women?\u201d\n\u201cNot able to hold a conversation, too uptight, not laid back enough, can\u2019t take a joke, things like that,\u201d he answered.\nHe learned a lot from the military and you can tell by his demeanor. He got to travel the world in the Air Force and plans to do much more when he\u2019s finished with school.\nRuss spends a lot of time in the gym, too. When he started undressing, the first thing I noticed was he wasn\u2019t wearing underwear. Then I noticed how tight his body was. Ripped abs, nice meaty, hairy legs, a thick cock and big low-hanging balls.\nRuss was fun to watch, and he\u2019s got a very unique jack-off method, a style I can only describe as the \"over under two hander.\" He stroked his cock until he shot his load not only on his shoulder, but all over the chair!\nLater on, we hit the beach but it was really chilly that day so we didn\u2019t stay for long. When we got back at home, I talked a little bit about his experience in the military \u2014 what his favorite thing about the Air Force was and what he hated.\n\u201cI really hated getting up so early in the morning,\u201d he said.\nSomehow I knew he wasn't a morning person!",
