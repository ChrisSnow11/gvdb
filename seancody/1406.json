  "description": "Everett LOVES swimming.\n\"I was a water baby from the very beginning,\" he said. \"I was in the pool every day. Those are my earliest memories.\"\nHe's definitely a west coast boy. Smooth, tanned swimmer's build, blond, and very distinctive tan lines!\nEverett was very eager and he brought a lot of excitement with him... as well as some words I hadn't heard in quite a while... \"gnarly\" and \"radical\" just to name a few.\n\"I think that you are the blondest person I've ever seen!\"\n\"Possibly!\" he said with a laugh.\nMan, his laugh is contagious. He had all of us going most of the afternoon. My sides hurt by the end of the day!\n\"Do people ever comment on your laugh?\"\n\"On my laugh?\"\n\"You have a very distinct laugh.\"\n\"Do I really?\" he replied, as if he didn't know.\n\"Dude... yeah!\"\n\"A few of my lady friends... they just tell me... like, dude you have, like, 15 different kinds of laughs!\"",
