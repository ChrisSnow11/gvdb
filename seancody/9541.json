  "description": "Martin has been playing ball his whole life and bragged about how good he was\u2026. little did we know how really good he actually was. \u201cI\u2019ve been swinging a bat for a few years now.\u201d He laughed \u201cDo you ever make it home!\u201d \u201cI make it on base and almost always slide into home!\u201d By now it was clear we were no longer talking about baseball. After showing off, he headed back to the studio where he stayed hard the entire time. \u201cI like the attention, what can I say?\u201d When it was time to bust, Martin shot one of the thickest loads I have ever seen. It was huge!",
