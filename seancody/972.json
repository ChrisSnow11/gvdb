  "description": "Alan is an airplane mechanic and his job has taken him all over the world. He's pretty modest about it, though.\n\"Yeah, I've been to a few places,\" he said.\nHis favorite?\n\"Amsterdam,\" he said with a big smile. \"Definitely Amsterdam.\"\nI wonder why!\nAlan is straight and he says he enjoys meeting women from all over the world.\n\"So many different types of women,\" he said. \"It's incredible.\"\nWhen I was talking with him, a completely off-the-wall question came to mind:\n\"So, when you're working on a plane, and there are people inside, do girls flirt with you through the window?\"\nI half expected him to give me a funny look, but instead he laughed like he knew exactly what I was talking about!\n\"Yeah,\" he said. \"Actually it happens quite a bit.\"\nSo the next time you're sitting on a plane, and you look out and see one of those hot guys in the work suit jumpers, you'll know!",
