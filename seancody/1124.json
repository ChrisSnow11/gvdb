  "description": "Oscar is a fascinating guy. He\u2019s intellectual to the point of being \u201cgeeky,\u201d yet he's incredibly social, friendly, and outgoing \u2014 not to mention he\u2019s cute and has a great body. As a kid, he was obsessed with the ocean and he fantasized about becoming a marine biologist. Now that he\u2019s an adult, he\u2019s changed gears a bit and now has a passion for nutritional science, and hopes to eventually get his Ph.D.\nSo, not only is he smart, he also has a great sense of humor and isn\u2019t afraid to make fun of himself. He takes care of his body by working out, running, biking and eating healthy. But that does not stop him from chowing down on chips or fries if he gets a craving. He says it\u2019s all about balance and not being afraid to indulge every once in a while.\nThere\u2019s a bit of a wild streak in him too. Not in the party sense, but more the adventurous kind. Oscar\u2019s not one to back down from a challenge, especially if it will test his endurance. And, he gets a big kick out of accomplishing things that people tell him he can\u2019t do. Oscar\u2019s least favorite word is \u201cno\u201d and, because of that, he got a tattoo on his 20th birthday that reads, \u201cNo Means Yes\u201d.\nI was curious about that, particularly because of where the tattoo is placed \u2014 right above his pubes. I wondered if he put it there as some kind of a joke for when he\u2019s getting head. Well, I was surprised by his answer:\n\u201cWhen somebody tells me not to do it, it might be for a good reason but you should find out for yourself because it\u2019s going to take you places. Good or bad, you have to find out.\u201d",
