  "description": "\"I don't like being alone,\" Cameron told us.\nHe was referring to the fact that, although he's kind of quiet, he's very social and likes to have people around all the time.\n\"I've never lived by myself,\" he said. \"I've always had friends or family around.\"\nHe's 19, and currently lives with two other guys in an apartment near the university he attends.\n\"It's pretty wild,\" he said. \"At least one of us always has a girl there.\"\nThey've gotten comfortable with that and the girls don't seem to mind.\n\"You don't have a system? Like hanging a sock on the doorknob?\"\n\"No we don't really care,\" he said. \"I'll come home and my buddy will be fucking some chick in the next room. It's no big deal.\"\nCameron likes to take his turn bringing girls home as well.\n\"Usually I have four girlfriends at a time, so I'm never worried about not having a girlfriend!\"",
