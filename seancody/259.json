  "description": "Curtis was a referral from another photographer. When he showed up for our first meeting, I couldn't believe how well he was dressed. Expensive shirt, nice leather jacket, the works. He's definitely very well groomed for a straight guy!\nCurtis was remarkably easy to work with. He has to be one of the nicest models I've ever dealt with. And what a body \u2014 muscular, vascular, and tight!",
