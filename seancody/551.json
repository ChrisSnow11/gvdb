  "description": "Bernie is an 18-year-old straight guy from the midwest who describes himself as a \"really chill person.\"\nHe just graduated from high school and is studying to become an electrician because he heard that's where the money is.\nThe one thing that really makes his eyes light up is when he talks about his girlfriend of two years.\n\"She was kind of a goody-goody before she met me,\" he said.\n\"Did you corrupt her?\" I asked.\n\"Kind of. But she still listens to her parents and gets really good grades.\"\nThen I asked him about the tattoo on his torso.\n\"It's Hawaiian for 'family',\" he said. \"Family means a lot to me.\"",
