  "description": "When I first met Adam, the first thing I noticed was that he bears a striking resemblance to Jon-Erik Hexum, a gorgeous model/actor from the 1980s.\nI mentioned this to Adam, and when he said \"who?\" I knew I had thoroughly dated myself, so I changed the subject.\nThe thing about Adam is he is very sweet and very personable. Plus, he has one of the nicest asses I have ever seen.\nAdam actually did two movies for me. In the first one, he was a little scruffy so I asked him to shave. He did a second one, but I think he looks good no matter what... so I put segments of both shoots into this movie (including both cum shots).",
