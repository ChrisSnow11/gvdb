  "description": "<p>After I got to know Braden, I got the definite impression that he was a late bloomer. You know, the tall, lanky, skinny kid who's painfully shy, and then all of a sudden, the muscles pop out and he's hot!</p>\n<p>According to him, though, the muscles came through hard work.</p>\n<p>&quot;I'm a hard gainer,&quot; he said. &quot;It was tough at first to put any weight on.&quot;</p>\n<p>Now, he&rsquo;s a competition swimmer and polo player who trains daily and maintains a very strict diet to keep him in top shape for the water.</p>\n<p>But, he's still kind of shy. Talking about girls made him look at the floor and blush!</p>\n<p>Braden has really nice pecs, which he mainly attributes to swimming (his favorite stroke is the butterfly). When he&rsquo;s not swimming, he&rsquo;s running or working out. </p>\n<p>His favorite part of the shoot?</p>\n<p>He loved showing some of his speed training moves... running with a parachute behind him at the beach!</p>",
