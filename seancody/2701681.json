  "description": "<p>Pavel is half Bosnian and half American. He's travelled around Europe and the States but had never been to the Pacific coast. </p>\n<p>&quot;This is your first time in the Pacific? California?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;First time!&quot; He smiled.</p>\n<p>&quot;What do you think?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Not bad at all. The ocean is great. The weather is great and the people are really laid back.&quot;</p>\n<p>He really loved it here. He was all about spending his day at the beach and in the ocean even though he didn't like the salt water very much!</p>\n<p>He keeps busy with work in the morning and school at night...and, of course, hitting the gym. He's got a nice lean, muscled, swimmer's build with hairy pecs. He's also got great hairy legs, a furry butt and cock...just the perfect amount of hair everywhere!</p>",
