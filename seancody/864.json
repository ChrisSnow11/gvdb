  "description": "Rex is 30 years old and he's a little change of pace!\nHe's got a ripped body that is the result of years of \"natural\" body building. He's been competing in shows and hopes to take first in his division this season.\nAfter working as a mortgage broker (yeah, I know) for most of his twenties, he's gone back to school to study accounting. His goal is to become a CPA.\nThe other thing that is unusual about Rex is that he's married.\n\"It's coming up on four years now,\" he said. \"It's great. I love it.\"\nI think the funniest thing he had to say was how he felt about flat-chested women: \"You know, I have no personal distaste for them as people,\" he said tongue-in-cheek. Then he smiled and said: \"I need boobs.\"",
