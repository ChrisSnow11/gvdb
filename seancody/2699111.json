  "description": "<p>Chad loves football!</p>\n<p>&quot;I've been playing it since I was a kid,&quot; he said. &quot;All through middle school and high school... I was on the football team...&quot;</p>\n<p>He's 21 now and playing on a collegiate level.</p>\n<p>&quot;So you're good then I take it?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I like to think so,&quot; he said. &quot;It just takes a lot of practice.&quot;</p>\n<p>Chad is certainly built for it too. He's 210 pounds of muscle!</p>\n<p>&quot;I work out 6 to 7 days a week,&quot; he said. &quot;I spend a lot of time in the gym.&quot;</p>\n<p>Chad's muscles are really nice, but I liked his balls the best &#8212; he's got some great low hangers!</p>",
