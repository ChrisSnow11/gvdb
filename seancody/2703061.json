  "description": "<p>Everett LOVES swimming.</p>\n<p>&quot;I was a water baby from the very beginning,&quot; he said. &quot;I was in the pool every day. Those are my earliest memories.&quot;</p>\n<p>He's definitely a west coast boy. Smooth, tanned swimmer's build, blond, and very distinctive tan lines!</p>\n<p>Everett was very eager and he brought a lot of excitement with him... as well as some words I hadn't heard in quite a while... &quot;gnarly&quot; and &quot;radical&quot; just to name a few.</p>\n<p>&quot;I think that you are the blondest person I've ever seen!&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Possibly!&quot; he said with a laugh.</p>\n<p>Man, his laugh is contagious. He had all of us going most of the afternoon. My sides hurt by the end of the day!</p>\n<p>&quot;Do people ever comment on your laugh?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;On my laugh?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;You have a very distinct laugh.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Do I really?&quot; he replied, as if he didn't know.</p>\n<p>&quot;Dude... yeah!&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;A few of my lady friends... they just tell me... like, dude you have, like, 15 different kinds of laughs!&quot;</p>",
