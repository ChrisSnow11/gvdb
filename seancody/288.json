  "description": "When I found Thor, he had been showing off for some girls skating on the beach boardwalk. Not being used to concrete that had a dusting of sand, he had taken a dive and had some bad scrapes. He was only here visiting friends for a few weeks, but fortunately there was enough time to let his wounds heal before the cameras came on.\nI wouldn\u2019t have pegged Thor as a skater since he lives in a conservative town on the east coast. He\u2019s someone I could see running for public office one day \u2014 he's got the hair for it, at least! In fact, he kind of looks like a Russian version of the late John F. Kennedy, Jr.\nAfter he shot his first load, I had him show off some of his boarding moves. Fortunately for us, this time he didn\u2019t hurt himself!",
