  "description": "Lane has really strict parents.\n\"I love them,\" he said. \"But I was very, very happy when it came time to go to college!\"\nApparently, they had really strict curfews and were very particular about whom he could invite to the house. And of course, no girls!\nHe described himself as an \"A\" student in high school who played sports, but was also kind of nerdy.\n\"When I turned 18, I decided I wanted to go to school in another state,\" he explained. \"And when I got there, it was like 'Whew!'\"\n\"I didn't know what to do with all the freedom!\"\nSo now, he's making up for lost time and seeing several girls at once!",
