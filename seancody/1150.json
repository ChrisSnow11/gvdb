  "description": "Alek is originally from Eastern Europe and he moved to the United States about ten years ago. He loves it here but admits to really missing football \u2014 or what we in America call soccer. He\u2019s joined local soccer camps and school teams, but he says it\u2019s just not the same the same \u2014 according to him, Europeans have a passion for (anything related to) soccer that is 100 times more than Americans have for football.\nHe wanted to know if we had soccer fields or where they might be playing some matches. So we went to the park to see him in action. He wasn\u2019t kidding about his passion for the sport. He\u2019s a monster on the field and for a tall guy (6\u20195\u201d) he\u2019s quick. And, like any good soccer player, he hit some phenomenal headers. One hit his head so hard I thought he was going to give himself a concussion. When I asked him if it hurt, his response was, \u201cIt always feels good!\u201d\nEven in clothes, you can tell Alek is athletic. Once the clothes come off, you see he's built \u2014 lean and defined with thick, muscular legs and a round, hairy bubble ass. There\u2019s a cool confidence about him that\u2019s infectious, like he\u2019s always on top of the world. But, he\u2019s also a jokester who prides himself on being somewhat of a cheese-ball. It\u2019s nice that he doesn\u2019t take himself so seriously.\nAlek is uncut and he\u2019s got some serious foreskin, which he says makes masturbating extra pleasurable!",
