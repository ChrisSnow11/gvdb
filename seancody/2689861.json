  "description": "<p>Paul is your classic football-player, wrestler type. In fact, one of his favorite hobbies is participating in martial arts fight clubs. He's also kind of a horn dog too... wait until you hear what his idea of a good date is!</p>\n<p>And speaking of dating, one of the most interesting things he told me about himself was that about 8 months ago he was on one of these reality dating shows where you have four guys and one girl. You know the one... where the girl eliminates the guys one by one until there is a &quot;winner&quot;. Apparently, the gang went swimming and Paul (being the exhibitionist he is) decided to jump naked into the pool. The folks at the network aired the segment but blurred out the best part. Well I am proud to say that there is no blurring here... you get to see what the rest of America didn't!!</p>",
