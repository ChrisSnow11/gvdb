  "description": "Ace seems to be a perfect name for this guy. It goes with his rockabilly look!\nHe's a lean muscular guy with, well, a lot of tatts, but that dick of his is substantial and nearly perfect (if you like big fat straight cut cocks that is)\nAce has a serious girlfriend, but is down with doing guy on guy stuff (he has done work before) and I believe he has danced in clubs.\nIronically, he said that he thought all the guys doing the videos were at least bi. I don't share that opinion as I deal with most of the guys really pushing their limits and though they look like they are having fun, it takes quite a bit of effort to make it look \"easy.\"\nBut I think his statement kind of Outed him as admitting he was at least bi. He certainly surrounds himself around a gay audience, but I don't know if that has more to with him liking the attention, or money he can make while entertaining them.\nHe was also not happy about showing off his ass, but I gotta say, he really showed it off better than most. A sign that he has done video work before!\nI think I will have him come back and do a Serviced video. Not sure about full on work, as he seems to have set opinions on what he will and wont do, and VERY high expectations of pay.\nBut for now, enjoy this quasi-straight and cocky boy!",
