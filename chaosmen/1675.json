  "description": "Conan is a pretty big name to live up to, but the minute he saw the name available, our model picked Conan because it was his favorite childhood hero.\nOUR Conan is a fighter too, doing all kinds of martial arts. Though he isn't all steroidal looking as the Conan movie character, he has the Will and Desire to do battle just like his movie hero.\nConan is a super friendly guy, very eager to please, and did an awesome job for the photos. For the video he got a little stage fright, so got a little quiet as his dick didn't spring to life like it did for photos.\nHe still plays well to the camera, and after the shoot was more confident about working in front of the camera and was eager to do a Serviced video with someone to \"play\" against. He is one of those guys where the Serviced video is dramatically different than the solo.\nSo stay tuned next week to see him get his dick drained dry!",
