  "description": "Ok, so whacky name, but hopefully a memorable name for a memorable hot guy!\nBalthazar is a natural in front of the camera. He actually moves around, changes his expression from photo to photo - definitely a camera-ready guy.\nHe is one of those guys that sent in his pics, and said he was straight, and I looked at his pictures and was like, \"Ummm...really?\" Then the minute I saw him at the airport and drove him to the studio, I was quickly doing an about face on that opinion. A couple words out of his mouth, and the dude is definitely straight.\nAs I said, he loved the camera, and the solo was super easy for him. He clearly loves to show-off for you, and plays to \"you\" like he is jerking just for you.\nI would love to have Balthazar back for more, but I think since everyone thinks he is gay, he is not too keen on confusing people more about it, and seemed pretty set against doing \"more.\"\nHe seemed to have a fine time, but my gut tells me he is likely only down for doing solos for studios for now. But then again, I am sometimes surprised.\nBalthazar is one smoldering hot dude, so enjoy the photos and the video!",
