  "description": "When Jamison came out, he brought one of his friends with him. His buddy's solo airs next week.\nThey weren't ready to play with each other, but I figure I can get them to interact in some way in the future.\nJamison is not very tall - about 5'7\" on a good day. He has got a stocky build, but I think he wears it well, and makes him charming and extra hot. He just looks like a dude. I think he would look great with Clay or even Gerin.\nJamison is open-minded. He says his brother is gay, and he has messed around with guys when he was young, but overall, he identifies as a straight guy.\nHe is actually quite well-endowed for a \"little\" guy, and I dunno, he just has that something charming and endearing that makes you want to get him naked to play with.\nJamison has got some great furry, muscular, and enviable pecs on him!\nAnd what a smile!\nJamison should be back for more, so stay tuned.",
