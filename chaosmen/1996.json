  "description": "I think Tristan is a super handsome guy. He has a great face, an amazing body, and he even grew his hair out just for us...though he promptly shaved it off the day after shooting his videos. Sigh.\nI had been working to get Tristan in for what seems like years. He moved around, started new jobs, and always had some pressing obligation. Finally he just said to lock in a date, and he finally got into the studio. I was not disappointed after waiting so long!\nHe was a bit nervous, but clearly you can see he has posed for photos before. His solo is solid, and he is definitely having a lot of fun. He was one of those guys that trying to not to nut the entire time. Turned-on by getting to show-off for us.\nHe will be back next week for a Serviced video, so stay-tuned!",
