  "description": "If you think you are confused by these guy's sexuality, I'm standing there right beside ya.\nMeet Bralin. He emailed me asking if he had the potential to be a ChaosMen model. He sent me some hot camcaps, his hair styled many ways, and of course the large Chesire Cat tattoo. Fun expressive images. Tattoos can be a tough sale to some of you, but there was so much raw sexuality and a fun attitude in his images and letter, that I jumped at getting him out for a shoot.\nHe said he was bi, but mostly straight, and he watched only guy-on-girl porn during his shoots. So it's strange, even to me, when the guy can really get it on full-force with a guy, but be equally in to girls. Bralin just seems like a really sexual guy.\nI had a lot of fun doing his photos. We shot him with his trademark cap on (which I left on in his solo for you ball cap fetish guys) but then we rolled out his naturally curly hair that is in all honestly, STUNNING. Even if you don't like longer hair on a dude, you have to admit, he works it like no other model I have seen anywhere. I'm totally taken with him, and like Jonatan, I wanted to bring some Reality to his images. Hence some smoking and cell phone picks..cuz that boy was on the phone or having a cigarette at any free moment he could find!\nHe is incredibly versatile with his moods-going from mischievous, laughing, serious, and sensual.\nBralin is equally versatile in bed, and you will soon be seeing him in action, fucking and getting fucked.\nEnjoy!",
