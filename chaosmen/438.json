  "description": "Scott's got military looks written all over him. He's also kind of got that all-American apple pie thang goin' on. He seems like a super nice guy too. Some of the innocent guys have a hidden naughty-side, but I think Scott is pretty much a \"what you see is what you get\" type of guy. He' matter-of-fact, and straight forward.\nHe's a little powerhouse too. I love his buff meaty build, and I think his tatts totally complete his style.\nA high school wrestler, he is truly a boy you'd want to roll around in bed with and get a headlock on with.\nWhen I edited his video, I kept singing \"Bouncy bouncy balls\" (editing video can get boring, the mind wanders) His nuts have got to have the most motion of any of the models I have had the pleasure to film. Bounce! Bounce! BOUNCE!\nI wonder if he likes to have them tugged on?\nHe's about as masculine as they come, and have to admit, it would be awesome to see if I could talk him in to an 'edge' video. Do something naughty to the innocent boy wonder!",
