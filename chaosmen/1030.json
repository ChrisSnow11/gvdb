  "description": "I can't escape the fact that Rush looks a bit like Clark Kent, with his Brill Creme hair, shy smiles, and perhaps a little clumsy.\nThough his body is not from Krypton, he has been on a kick to get in better shape, and I think he is looking pretty dang good considering the weight he says he lost.\nHe was very shy during the photo shoot, but geez, when I turned on the video cameras, he literally turned into a super man!\nVery engaging with the camera and it has that \"you are there and he is looking right at you\" feel to it.\nI like this kid, very sweet and humble, straight out of Smallville.\nIf you are a fan of pre-cum, you will love the way his dick keeps producing it. Mostly during the photos, but we did get a video moment when he showcased that extra ooze!\nHe's not sure about getting a blow job, but I think it would be a waste to not get him to come back given how into the solo he was.",
