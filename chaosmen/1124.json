  "description": "Miles is a laid back country boy, who had just gotten a new puppy, so we needed to move quickly through his shoot cuz his puppy needed to be let out after a couple hours.\nHe still seemed very relaxed and had lots of fun showing off for the camera.\nMiles probably hears it on occasion, but I think he looks like a grown-up Haley Joel Osment ('I see dead people' fame), toss in a dash of Edward Norton and you have one cute guy!\nMiles is straight and I never got a chance to see if he wanted to come back and do more interactive stuff. He seem open-minded, so if you guys like him I will for sure ask him to come on back. But I think he just needed some quick cash to pay for his new puppy!",
