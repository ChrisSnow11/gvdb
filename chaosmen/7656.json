  "description": "Nathan is a chef and a surfer dude.\nHe spends his time on the coast line, working at nice restaurants, so he can spend time catching the waves. You can tell by the nautical theme his tattoos have, that his main love is the ocean. He is little like a typical surfer dude, very chill and relaxed about life, though it does sound like he takes his chef duties very serious. He is all about food and fun in the sun!\nHe is also an artist. He does his own tattoos and brought a sketch book with him to keep himself occupied while traveling.\nHe is straight, but seems open-minded. He is not sure about sucking dick back. He says he does appreciate a girl's ass first, though not a huge fan of fucking it. In bed, he seems more of a romantic, trying to kiss her neck and get her turned on makes him happy.\nNathan has a nice natural bush, which really pops nicely on his naturally hairless body. His cock looks awesome nestled in those pubes! Takes him no time at all to wake his cock up, and he has a really nice stroking action that showcases his cock!",
