  "description": "Does anyone think Sterling and Dusty are cut from the same cloth? I worked with both guys within days of each other, and they both have the same look to them. Both are a little tough looking, similar tatts, similar facial hair, even their builds are alike.\nAnd like Sterling, Dusty seems pretty eager to do video work. We have yet another totally confident performer!\nDusty gets hard easy, cums easily and right when he wants, and plays to the camera. He is looking at himself on the monitors, cameras and me, but he is totally not camera shy!\nHe did manage to get into a car accident the week before, and he has a few bruises. Mostly his lower lip inside his mouth was little cut, but it sure didn't slow him down performing for us.\nI am gonna pair him up with someone who has more experience for the oral, but after editing and writing summaries for both Sterling and Dusty, I really have got to get the two together. It is strange how two guys from different sides of the country can just randomly appear in the studio, and be so similar. Maybe I should add a third guy in to that scene to really spice it up.\nRegardless of future pairing, Dusty will be back next week to receive some head, and it seems like he is down for 'whatever' we can throw at him, so it's likely he will be back for a handful of vids!",
