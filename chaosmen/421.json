  "description": "Zack was a referral from another model who had worked on the set with him on another production. They found out they had more in common than just the city they had flown out from, and I'm not sure I would say they are dating, but they've definitely become close.\nZack's done a lot of work before, so hopefully fans will enjoy seeing these great photos as well as this awesome solo. No worries on just getting a solo of him as he will be back in a week or so, getting it on with a dude.\nI asked him to do a strip tease for the camera, something I have never really done before. He is pretty much an extrovert when it comes to these things and it was fun to have a dude really get off on showing off, rather than being all nervous-like (which is not without its charms either)\nThe boy oozes sensuality and playfulness, and that cock is just amazing!\nZack is a cerebral boy. He was one of those smarty-pants kids that competed in speed chess, music and band, and likely excelled top honors at all of his genius level courses. He loves philosphy and logic and critical thinking. It's refreshing talking with a \"geeky\" kid who came in to being all hot and sexy, and can still talk about the meaning of the universe and String Theory.\nAnd yes, those are hearing aids.\nThis is a top notch solo, practically filmed in Real-Time.\nEnjoy!",
