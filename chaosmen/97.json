  "description": "A friend found Alexi while he was home for the holidays. My friend spends a lot of time at the gym, and Alexi is real interested in physical fitness and personal training. The two hit it off immediately. It wasn't long before he was asking Alexi if he wanted to go to California for a photoshoot/video.\nObviously Alexi was suspicious, but after checking out the site, he was down for it.\nThe week of the shoot, Alexi emailed me asking if I might want to photograph him with his identical twin brother. Would I?! He said his brother was not as fitness-oriented as he is, and might just do some nude photos together with him, but def. nothing erotic. I told him I completely understood, and would love to of course work with twins. But the timing was a challenge; I couldn't find a flight that worked out with everyone's schedule. A shoot for a later time perhaps.\nAlexi is another one of those guys that you can tell eases in to any social situation. Good conversation and very friendly. I totally enjoyed the time I got to spend with Alexi, and would get him and or his brother out here again for more work in a heart beat.",
