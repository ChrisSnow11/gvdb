  "description": "Sterling is a straight guy who seems to be a little curious about guys. He has his own business, and it sounds like he is really on top of things, but some extra money is always appreciated.\nHe has a dynamic personality, super friendly and easy to chat and work with. He is a dad and been with the same girl for 6 years, so he is a real stable guy. But I think he once messed around with a guy when he was VERY young, and just that one incident put him in the mind that he could likely do some guy-on-guy stuff.\nHe still will likely need to work though his limits, but he is eager to please and show-off for you all.\nHe is a confident performer, and if you like your guys a little rough trade, you will totally enjoy watching him!\nSterling will be back next week to swap head with one of the of the guys from Team Chaos!",
