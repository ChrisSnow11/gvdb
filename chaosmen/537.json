  "description": "So you met Zeph a couple weeks ago in the Edge video. I actually filmed this solo before the Edge vid, but felt like airing the Edge video first would have a bit more impact.\nZeph is a hot military guy, and you will note not only does he have a large number of tatts (how could you miss 'em) but has a pretty big scar across his mid section.\nTo be honest I debated working with Zeph. Tatts are a hard sell to you all, and the scar is pretty good. But he got that scar when a bomb blew up on him in Iraq, and it bothers me that we don't actually get to see the damage to our men and women fighting in that war.\nSo without trying to make too much of a political stand through porn, I thought it was a important to not only show what's happening to our guys and gals, but to continue to support them by tossing work their way.\nThat being said, Zeph if friggen adorable. I love his face. He goes from angelic to sly in seconds, and he's got that impish quality that you know means he is up to no good.\nAnd that stick of his screams \"porn cock\", which matches his sexy attitude that announces, \"lets fuck now!\" like no other.\nHe also likes to talk dirty and loved egging me on the whole time. Now you know why I wanted to Edge with him!",
