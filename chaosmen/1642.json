  "description": "I seem to be getting models coming from other studios lately. What can I say, I'm Green! I Recycle!\nI was happy to get \"Booker\" in as he is super eager to please, has a tight beefy wrestler body, and a willingness to push his limits.\nI know he has done video work before, but I always like to get a solo in, just to see how they respond to the way I film, kind of a training session, plus I get to gauge their energy and chemistry.\nI really liked working with Booker. He was all sexually charged up, and though he identifies as straight, I think we both agreed there is a 'Bi' side to him that he has been itching to scratch again. Plus the money helps!\nStay tuned next week for a Serviced video that gets a little out of hand!",
