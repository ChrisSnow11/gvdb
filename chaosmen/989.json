  "description": "Oh boy is Asher ever a cutey!\nShy but confident, and not at all conceited, he just seems like a well put together kid.\nHe told me he was a wrestler, and I can't believe I didn't notice his banged up wrestler's ears during the entire shoot (Perhaps I was looking elsewhere)\nI would love to get him come back to do more, but I think he hit is limit on the solo. So he is one of those guys you should enjoy now for sharing a little glimpse into their private life.\nIt's a shame 'cuz I think he is just one of those guys that really responds well to being filmed, showing off, and generally can get into playing with the audience.\nI will keep my fingers crossed!",
