  "description": "Jet black hair and green eyes, yowie, Javen is an amazing looking guy!\nHe says he goes for the cheerleader type of girl, but is trying to get out that trend. Apparently, there is a quite a bit of drama with high maintenance girls.\nHe's just a very likable and sexy guy that seems very down to Earth, professional, as well as polite. Someone you would take home to meet mom.\nAnd that sweet looking exterior harbors a naughty boy inside, and thankfully he is willing to share his private time with us.\nNot sure he will be coming back for more. He's worried about friends/family finding out, but I think he is a realist and needs to pay bills. Some guys I know for certain will be a \"No Go\" but with Javen, I think the logic of getting the extra money may outweigh his worry about getting found out.\nSo if you know Javen or his compadres, keep it on the down low for him!",
