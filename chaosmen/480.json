  "description": "Vincent took a 3-day train trip to come do photos and video for you. That's 6-days of travel so he could come and rub one off for us! He's not fond of flying and he actually suggested the train trip. Despite his phobia of flying, the boy has got an adventurous spirit, and looked at the trip as a way to explore the U.S.\nUpon arriving here, everyone kept asking him if he was Justin Timberlake, or telling him that he looks a lot like him. I have to agree, albeit a little more Latin, he sure does look a lot like the boy band wonder.\nVincent was a great model to work with. His dick was hard the entire time, loved being naked, and after not having any kind of sexual activity for five days, all he wanted to do was bust a nut.\nHe's one of the few guys who can really \"look\" at you with true sexual intensity, and I even left a few out takes in the middle that show how into it he was.\nAs for the photos, they are gorgeous! Even though Vincent oozes serious sexuality, he conveys a fun playful \"smirky\" side as well.\nHe originally came out only to do a solo, but after he found it was easy (and horny) he agreed to come and do \"more\" Look for that video in the coming month.\nEnjoy!",
