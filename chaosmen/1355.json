  "description": "Crew is a Southern Boy. He has done some stripping at gay clubs, and now is doing construction work. I think his idea is to work \"harder\" doing this kind of work than the toll construction work is taking on him.\nHe sure is adorable. Kinda shy, but has that \"come watch me vibe.\" Perhaps a true exhibitionist. I love working with these guys because they play to the camera so well.\nThe contrast of shyness and exhibitionism are not the only thing to be at odds. He definitely identifies as straight, but he has on occasion messed around with a guy.\nHe seemed ok about the solo, but not too sure about going further, even just doing oral. At the time of filming, it sounded like he had done work before and was not planning on committing to one studio.\nI really liked working with him and think he has a ton of potential!",
