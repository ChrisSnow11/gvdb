  "description": "Drederick is a very quiet dude, with a hot gymnast body.\nSo he wasn't very forthcoming with personal details or insights.\nBut he did say one of his straight friends did a gay-for-pay-site, and one of their gay friends blabbed it to anyone and everyone who listened, including the guy's girlfriend and eventually, his family.\nI hate it when that happens, I think us older dawgs seem keep a lid on our friends sexual activities, most especially from our parents.\nI think the younger generation doesn't do this anymore. Can't keep a secret or maybe thinks it's just too juicy of a detail to not pass on. Like their own private Jerry Springer show. I dunno.\nSo from the outset, Drederick flatly said, \"No way!\" to any gay work because of what happened to his buddy.\nIt's a shame 'cuz I think he is way adorable and probably would be a great performer if he wasn't so worried about his friends finding out.\nSo if you know a dude on the site, keep the secret to yourself, you are ruining for me to get these guys to get their gay on!",
