  "description": "<p>Joseph is 19 and wants to open a dance club.</p>\n<p>&quot;You'd be too young to even go into your own place,&quot; I joked with him. &quot;If you served alcohol, that is.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I'm in college now,&quot; he said. &quot;So that's still a few years out anyways.&quot;</p>\n<p>He's not in a hurry to finish college, and says his priorities right now are &quot;skating and partying.&quot;</p>\n<p>He has a girlfriend, but isn't keen on being in a relationship.</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah, you gotta steer clear of those,&quot; he said. I wasn't sure if he meant a girlfriend or a relationship.</p>\n<p>And then he clarified: &quot;Girls always gotta know where you're at, always gotta know what you're doing...&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;So you're kind of a free spirit. You don't like to be monitored?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;No, I'm just trying to do my own thing...&quot;</p>\n<p>I suggested (half jokingly) that he might want to give guys a try.</p>\n<p>&quot;If you find the right guy, you could get your rocks off and still do your own thing.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Hmmm...&quot; he said. &quot;I hadn't thought of that.&quot;</p>",
