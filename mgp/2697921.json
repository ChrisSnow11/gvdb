  "description": "<p>Trent is hoping to compete in the 2012 Olympics.</p>\n<p>&quot;I'm a triathlete,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm training full time.&quot;</p>\n<p>To be honest, I'd never met anyone who was a potential Olympian, so I was curious.</p>\n<p>I asked him about how difficult it is to qualify.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's extremely difficult,&quot; he said. &quot;But I work as hard as I can and hopefully that will be good enough.&quot;</p>\n<p>Trent is 21 years old, Greek/Italian, and he has a girlfriend he's been with for a few years.</p>\n<p>&quot;She keeps me going,&quot; he said. &quot;She's my biggest fan!&quot;</p>",
