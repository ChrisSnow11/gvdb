  "description": "<p>&quot;So we have another military boy,&quot; our interviewer said. &quot;You just got out of the Marines.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes, Sunday actually,&quot; Evan said. Sunday had been a mere two days prior.</p>\n<p>&quot;I was a combat air traffic controller,&quot; Evan explained.</p>\n<p>&quot;So you basically blew up bad guys,&quot; our interviewer replied.</p>\n<p>&quot;Pretty much, yeah.&quot;</p>\n<p>When asked about his orientation, Evan replied &quot;gay,&quot; and when asked about his pitcher/catcher status he laughed and said, &quot;I'm versatile.&quot;   </p>\n<p>Why are all Marines so fucking hot? I mean really. Evan has puppy dog eyes with a perfect smile and a lean, ripped body. And he's gay to boot!</p>\n<p>&quot;What's your favorite position when you're getting pounded?&quot; he was asked.</p>\n<p>He laughed, then replied, &quot;Doggie style. Actually, it's reverse cowboy.&quot;</p>\n<p>And finally: &quot;Does your boyfriend know that you're doing this?&quot;</p>\n<p>Still laughing, Evan replied, &quot;Uh, yeah.&quot;</p>\n<p>Now if it seems like the interviewer already knew all the answers to the questions before he asked them, it's because he did. Evan is the interviewer's boyfriend!</p>\n<p>Yes, we have a hot staff here at SeanCody.com!      </p>\n<p>&nbsp; </p>",
