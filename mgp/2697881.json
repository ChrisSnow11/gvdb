  "description": "<p>Jay was recruited into collegiate football right out of high school.</p>\n<p>&quot;I had several universities that were interested,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>He chose one, and was linebacker on his team for two years before he decided college wasn't for him.</p>\n<p>&quot;It was fun,&quot; he said. &quot;There were hot girls everywhere.&quot;</p>\n<p>Yeah, being a good-looking linebacker is probably up there on the list of &quot;How to Attract Hot Girls.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;But,&quot; he added, &quot;I was kind of bored.&quot; </p>\n<p>So what did he do instead?</p>\n<p>&quot;I decided I wanted to go to culinary school,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to start my own restaurant when I'm done.&quot;</p>\n<p>Apparently he's quite the chef. And the girls he dates love it!</p>\n<p>&quot;It's the best way to a woman's heart!&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>(I think that translates to: the best way to get a woman into bed.)</p>\n<p>&quot;A nice romantic dinner with candles. They love it.&quot;</p>",
