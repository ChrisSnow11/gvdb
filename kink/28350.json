  "description": "We have an exciting Tag team Match with Team Red ( Bella Rossi and Mischa Brookes) going up against Team Blue ( Darling and Rilynn Rae). This match up is pretty even with one vet and one rookie on each team. There's a lot of Tension between the veterans on each team. In Season 8, Darling was robbed of her chance to move up to the finals when her match with Bella was stopped prematurely due to injury. Darling has been carrying a grudge ever since. Bella wants to prove once and for all that can whoop Darling's ass any given day of the week. But for the first round each team captain ( the veterans) decided to let the rookies start out and prove themselves on the mats. The round is closely contested to the bitter end. The team with a better strategy for using tags ends up on top. With Ariel X stepping in for her first time on a tag match as Ref. Vendetta makes a Cameo appearance as co-ref.",
