  "description": "Season Seven Match\nTIA LING\nJade\nHT: 5'1\nWT: 102lbs\nSeason record (2-0)\nLifetime record (3-2)\nRanked 8th\nHOLLY HEART\nThe Hit Man\nHT: 5'6\nWT:145 lbs\nSeason record (0-3)\nLifetime record (0-3)\nRanked 13th\nTia Ling is the featherweight Ultimate Surrender superstar. At 5'1 and 102lbs this little Asian power house is fierce. Her only loss this season was to the Dragon, and with the Summer Vengeance Tournament coming up no one want a loss to drop them in rankings.\nHolly Heart is one of the strongest rookies we have had to date. She is looking for her first win against the much smaller veteran. Holly is ready for a victory.\nThis match was won and lost in the very last second of the match. One of the most exciting finishes we have ever filmed. Do not miss this great match up!",
