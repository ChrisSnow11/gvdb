  "description": "Deportment is the way one express oneself through facial features and by the way one moves or holds their body. Some slaves evoke appropriate deportment, some don't. Today we give the new meat, kahill, some training on walking and moving gracefully. We then evaluate her performance to determine her role at the next event. Depending on how she does, she will either get to walk around the next event like a human being, or she will instead crawl all night like a dog.",
