  "description": "dolly starts her day being interrogated. The point is to try to get her to let her guard down, and allow me to get into her head. I want to know what makes her tick, and to do that, I need her full honesty about everything. Next I throw her over my knee and humiliate her more than she thought possible.\nShe is then put in an intense suspension and made to endure heavy impact from a dragon-tail. The level of pain that this trainee takes is very impressive, but there has to be a point that she finally gives in, and I will find that point.\nTo finish the day she has to march through the gym, and it's rough terrain to the furthest corner away from her comfort zone. She then has to hold a coin between her nose and the wall, while taking 100 swings from a wooden paddle.",
