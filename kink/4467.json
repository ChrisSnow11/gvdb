  "description": "Skydiving\nThinking back to the day of the shoot, I remember being vaguely amused. As I turned the corner into the talent office in search of a model to bind, I came face to face with the same stare that greets me in the mirror each morning.\nWe sat down. We talked at each other over a checklist. She didn't ask any questions. She signed her name while digging through her purse.\nLater on, they brought her in from makeup. The interview went by as she posed for pictures, twisting her form this way and that.\nI began moving metal around to set up an idea and she wandered into a corner while scrolling through an electronic organizer. She's only 19 but she works 5-6 days a week. She has an agent, a web site, a book deal, a video blog. Booking her was a 3 month process.\nStripped naked on the table, bound to the cold metal, she looked like she might fall asleep but didn't. She looked at the goggles quizzically but adjusted them so all she could see was black.The vibrator caused a stir, but when the clamps went on she came to. One, five, ten, twenty...she writhed around screamed. She spit words out no one expected. She came so hard she looked like a fighter pilot in gravity training, gritting her teeth with her lips curled back.The camera stopped and the straps came off. She sat up and removed the goggles. Her eyes came into focus. I could tell she had finally arrived in the room.",
