  "description": "Beretta is subjected to delightfully cruel predicament bondage in this update. Scene one Mz Berlin and Claire Adams torment Beretta while she is sitting in a metal stock system. She is then pulled into a standing crouch in the metal device and given orgasm denial and lots of nipple torment. In scene two Beretta becomes a latex visionary. She is installed in a full latex head balloon, corset, latex box tie arm binder, and bound spread in between two poles. Claire pushes her around. With the intense sensory deprivation she is merely a puppet to be played with. Missy Minks is installed in a cage in the background to bear witness to Beretta's assault. In scene three, Beretta is bound in metal in a kneeling back arch. Mz Berlin tests her with clothespins and Claire makes Beretta kneel on nasty hard rice. In the final position, the cunt is bound on all fours like a bitch in heat. Her neck is in a wooden stock collar, her waist and limbs in metal. Claire challenges her to take a heavy dose of corporal then double penetrates her with dildos that the two Dommes take turn weilding. Missy watches in awe and astonishment of Beretta's ability to endure extreme bondage scenarios.",
