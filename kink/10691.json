  "description": "Tara wants to learn to be a \"proper submissive'. Indeed. Aiden and I feign intrigue and demand she strip and give a definition of the term. She has been called out and stammers through some fantasy BDSM literature bullshit and relates the term to ...service. Nice word.\n\nShe acts shy at first and is slow to respond to orders to present her cunt. As a result the bondage is real tight against her little pussy. It hurts. She learns she will give up that cunt when it is demanded. Pegging her ankles behind her ears and drilling her twat into spasms of denial underscore the instruction.\n\nNot letting her off the hook, she is made to defend her use of the term 'service' with a definition through painful gasps for air. Tara learns her fantasy is not what she thought it was.\n\nShe makes her own rules. She is surprised to find them strictly enforced to the syllable with a stiff, stinging cane. Her ordeal leaves her well used by days end, when she is finally allowed to show that maybe, possible she has learned something about the consequences of quantifying the submissive experience with subjective terms like 'proper' in the dungeon.",
