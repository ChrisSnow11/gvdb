  "description": "There is controversy as to Chaos's ranking of 7th. Some do not think she should be ranked at all. No wins and three big losses. So why is she ranked 7th? Well she gets a chance to prove herself worthy this week against another ranked opponent.\nThe Killer is ranked 6th, she is tall, strong and vicious on the mat, and that is all I really to say about that.",
