  "description": "Hit by painful bout of menstrual cramps, Lorelei Lee seeks out medical advice from Dr. Phoenix Askani. While Phoenix is used to treating many different maladies, she stutters and is at a loss when she prescribes the transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or TENS unit to help ease Lorelei's pain.\nLorelei, very experienced in electrical play, loses her patience and decides the doctor is the one who needs healing. She shows her the ins and outs of the TENS units. Under Lorelei's care, Dr. Phoenix is taught how TENS units with sticky pads, in conjunction with lesbian bondage, can be used to do more than just alleviate pain and heighten pleasure. Phoenix squirms as Lorelei works the unit, bringing the once prideful doctor under her control.\nOnce the initial consultation is complete, Lorelei dons an acrylic strap-on wired to the unit and takes Phoenix deeper into the subculture of electro sex. With the fake dick inside her, wired with electricity, Phoenix's eyes are opened to the true potential for play with the TENS unit. Phoenix, used to being the expert, submits to Lorelei's initiation into the world of kinky lesbian BDSM and is eager to learn more.\nIn her final lesson, Phoenix gives in entirely to Lorelei. With the help of a cattle prod, Phoenix's last session in electro BDSM makes her realize what she really wants is a place under Lorelei's boot.",
