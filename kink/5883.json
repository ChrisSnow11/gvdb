  "description": "Most of Cyd Black's Regular update material was used up weeks ago, but then we found this lost project hidden in the vault. So instead of destroying history, we present it.\nThis was an experiment, a creative thought by Cyd Black, directed by Alan Smithee to bring sex to the Device Bondage formula. Here is a glimpse back in time, to the beginning, to a unique vision that may or may not have led to brilliance. All we can say is that this path shall forever remain unknown. Except the first tentative step, which we present to you today.\nAs one of Cyd's last efforts its value to the membership is priceless.",
