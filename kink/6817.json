  "description": "Nomad is diagnosed as a masochist and he's locked up for his own good. Dak is a brutal nurse who thinks he's in charge. Dak wants to see if it's true that Nomad is really a masochist. After a hard corporal, Nomad just laughs. Dak pulls out the electricity and things get interesting. It's after midnight in the mental ward and there's no one around to hear Nomad screams... of pleasure.",
