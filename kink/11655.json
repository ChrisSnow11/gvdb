  "description": "Welcome to Tag Team Tuesdays. This is round 3 of 4 of the live December PLAYOFF matchup between Team Ice and The Ninjas.\nCould Team Ice hang on to their 20pt lead? Will the Ninjas neutralize Ariel X and keep her off the mat, so they can abuse poor rookie Iona in her first ever debut? The last 12 minutes of non-scripted playoff action is savage, fast paced and has some of the most brutal leg scissor holds we have ever seen. One team loses it all in front of the live audience, and their season is over. One team advances to the Championship matchup to take on the undefeated Dragons.",
