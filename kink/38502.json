  "description": "Learn the sexy, messy fun and torment of SPLOSHING: playing with sensation using food. Shae Flanigan demonstrates how you can create different sensations--with sticky textures, slippery textures, and foods with intoxicating smells--all layered on top of each other for a symphony of sensuality. It's a sexy art form where you transform someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s naked body into a palette you can see, smell, taste, and feel. Shae doesn't stop at the sensual; she shows you how to use different foods and textures, including repulsive foods, temperature extremes, and spicy hot sauces to inflict pain and punishment on your willing partner.",
