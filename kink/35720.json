The Hammer has a mixed record but has always shown himself to be one of the top fighters in our stable, with his two losses having come at the hands of some of Naked Kombat's best talent. The Beast is brand new but has the weight and height advantages to offset his lack of experience. Can The Hammer keep his winning streak alive? Or can The Beast break it through sheer manpower?",
