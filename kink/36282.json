  "description": "Mistress Kara is Undefeated and has been walking through the Ultimate Surrender roster with ease. She is the season 11 welter weight AND all round Summer Vengeance season 11 champion. She has an uncanny ability to make really great wrestlers look like amateurs. Most of her opponents are unable to even score a single point against her. She's arguably the best wrestler US has ever seen and she's one of the biggest. at 155lbs she was the biggest and strongest wrestler this season. Today she goes up against 3 time Summer Vengeance Champion, Ariel X. Ariel also has an impressive pedigree in wrestling. She is giving up over 30lbs to Kara and she doesn't have as much mat experience this season but she's got a lot of heart and she loves nothing more than to slay giants.",
