  "description": "The slaves workday begins by punching into a time clock camera. The stationary cam records the slave's arrival at the armory. If she is naked and present at 10:30, she on time. For every 5 minutes before 10:30 that she arrives, she earns one white ball. For every 5 minutes past, a black ball. At the end of each month, we count the balls and you, the members, help decide what's to be done with the slave.",
