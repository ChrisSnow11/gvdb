  "description": "Precarious\nI wasn't sure about her. When she arrived to do the shoot she was already nervous. She asked the kinds of questions that models ask when I know it's not going to work. But I needed a shoot, so I decided to try anyway.\nI didn't make it easy. I wanted her to suffer, to safeword, to be in way over her head. After the interview I stripped her ass bare and planted her on a board of painful spikes and strapped up her legs so she couldn't relieve the pressure with her legs. I let her sit for a long time, so the pain would slowly grow unbearable. I was sure she would break...but she didn't. She took it all, and then took more. She was scared and she was in pain, but she didn't quit. The result is this fantastic update.",
