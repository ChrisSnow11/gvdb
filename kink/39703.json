  "description": "Learn how to turn your partner into a living marionette or a rubber love doll. This tutorial demonstrates the mindset of a human doll and how a human doll maker can become a puppeteer with their partner as a marionette, using simple single-column bondage and an overhead frame to make them dance in partial suspension. Jessica Creepshow also transforms herself into a living love doll by slipping into a transparent latex full-body doll suit, complete with internal condoms, as Danarama poses and fucks her.\nThis episode is Part 2 of Kink University's Dollification series. For the introductory video, please see Dollification 101 (January 25, 2016) on KinkUniversity.com",
