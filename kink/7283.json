  "description": "Season Seven Match\nTHE DRAGON\nThe Dragon\nHT: 5'4\nWT: 135 lbs\nSeason record (0-0)\nLifetime record (24-5)\nJESSE COX\nThe Cheerleader\nHT: 5'2\nWT: 118lbs\nSeason record (0-0)\nLifetime record (0-0)\nThe Dragon is back, (24-5) she has beaten the likes of the Ninja, The Nightmare, Vendetta, The Goddess and The Grappler. When she's at the top of her game she is fearsome. However she is 2 years removed from the mat. Will she be able to get to her former level of competitiveness?.\nJesse is a hot little blonde living in CA. She did gymnastics and cheerleading in college, and she is still very active. She is fit, strong and determined to do well at US.\nThe Dragon pulled out moves we have never seen- legs scissors pussy licking! The Cheerleader never had a chance- she gets fingered and almost made to cum on the mat. She was a Dragon plaything, Jesse never thought she could be easily beaten physically and sexually.",
