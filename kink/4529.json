  "description": "The Tsunami (Christina Aguchi) is one of the strongest welterweights we have. Although she already had prior wrestling experience when she came in, she has gained even more experience since she has been here. The Tsunami was ranked 8th because of her skill strength and endurance.\nSpartica (ranked 16th) is now the smallest wrestler US has, at only 5'1 and 102 lbs. (She is outweighed by 38 lbs and gives up 2 inches) However rolled up into that tiny frame is a powerhouse that does her name proud. Spartica does not understand what tired is, she does not understand what weakness is. Her offense is relentless!",
