  "description": "In the third match of The Summer Smackdown Elimination Round we've pitted Brock \"The Big Show\" Avery against Mitch \"The Machine\" Vaughn. Both Kombattants enter the ring confidently with promises of hot loads covering the faces of the loser, but only one will end up on top at the round's end. The Big Show's NK experience, thus far, has mostly come from Tag Team match-ups. He has only one showing in singles, although it was a heavy handed victory for the young stud. The Machine, on the other hand, has really been on a hot streak in the regular season, making this tournament appearance with only one loss under his belt. The Big Show aims to prove that his lack of one-on-one preparedness is a non-issue, but The Machine has really gotten his head around the sport. With size to his advantage, The Machine looks to dominate his cocky opponent and move one step closer to being named champion.",
