  "description": "The subject of bondage can mean many things: sometimes it is about prolonged suffering, Sometimes it is about endurance and stamina, sometimes it is about a long bondage scene, where the captive is helpless for a long stretch while the Rigger takes the time to work his craft. It is not always about the most intense bondage position lasting three minutes. Sometimes it is about drawing the scene out so you can play with your captive longer and harder.",
