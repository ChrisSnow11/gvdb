  "description": "TAG TEAM LEAGUENOW IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE\n\nTEAM PURPLE\n\nVon Tess & Amber\nCombined HT:127\"\nCombined WT: 240lbs\nRecord:(2-1)\n\nTEAM BLUE\n\nHollie & Ami\nCombined HT:134\"\nCombined WT: 265lbs\nRecord:(1-2)\n\nWelcome to Ultimate Surrender's Tag Team League.\nTeam Purple vs Team Blue. Four girls,\nnon-scripted, real tag team action.\n\nThe rules are set: (1) Three tags per team, per round.\n(2) Three 12-minute non-scripted wrestling rounds. (3)\nLast round consists of the winners tying up,\ndominating, humiliating, and brutally fucking the\nlosers. IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE!\n\nThe regular Tag Team season comes to a close. This is the final match and the teams have been decided before the match takes place. Blue can not advance and Purple heads into the playoffs.\n\nHowever, team blue, the cursed team of 2008, has something to prove. Both original team members are out for various reasons, numerous stand ins have come and gone, and the team is still made up of stand ins. Team blue, despite never having the same team twice, fought hard and almost made the playoffs.\n\nThis match is one of the strangest craziest matches to date. Amber goes down during the match with an injury, and Vendetta, the referee, steps in, and a new referee is dragged in from the crowd... cats and dogs living together. Do not miss this one.",
