  "description": "Leon Fox\"The Masticator\"Ht: 5'11\" WT: 170lbs Season W/L record (0-0)Chris Bines\"Mr Bad-Ass\"Ht: 5'10\" WT: 165lbsSeason W/L record (0-0) Leon \"The Masticator\" Fox has years and years of martial arts training under his belt, and this is his first time on NK. From MMA to Kung Fu his extensive background is surely one not to underestimate. Fighting against The Masticator is newcomer Chris \"Mr Bad-Ass\" Bines. Mr Bad-Ass may not have formal training, but he's grown up fighting and scrapping throughout the years and he's more than confident in his street smarts. Both fighters have very different fighting styles, as they go toe to toe which one will prove to be superior? Masticator's technical background or Mr Bad-Ass' dirty, aggressive fighting style? Either way only one can be the winner and it's an all out fight for sexual glory and control.",
