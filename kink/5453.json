  "description": "Something is different with this one. Her movements have a slight but noticeable slowness to them, which she compensates for with an increase in fluid graceful motions.\nThere are other things as well. She has an accent, but it's strange..hard to place. When I ask her questions, she pauses and hesitates before answering. Just as I start to think she doesn't understand, she responds in complete, well phrased sentences.\nDuring the scenes it's almost impossible to tell whether she enjoys what's going on, hates it, is acting or otherwise. Normal intuition does not seem to apply to her.\nIn the end I decide to try and break her down, to find out if it's an act, to drill into her head and get the answers I want. I try and try and push the limits set by the company, but nowhere near her own. I leave the set with a great shoot, but no answers to any of my questions.",
