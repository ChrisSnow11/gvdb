Three girls,\nnon-scripted, real tag team action.\n\nThis is the new 2009 Tag Team Season. New teams; new wrestlers. The Beginning of what will be the most brutal Tag Team Season yet!\n\nMadison Young has replaced Yana Jordan on The Pirates. Yana is out indefinitely with a knee injury. With that said, Madison woke up very sick on match day, and try as we might, we could not find a replacement for the live event. So according to the rules, Dia took on Team Goddesses by herself. 8 minute rounds, Team Goddesses give 2 tags/rd.\n\nThis is the first time Team Goddesses is a whole team. Adrianna has recovered from her ankle injury and is back on the mat.",
