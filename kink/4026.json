  "description": "The Goddess was hurt all last season with a shoulder injury. She finished\nthe season ranked 5th, and has 29 [REDACTED] submissions to her name. She is\nhealed, she has trained, and she is ready for the championship.\nChaos is a tough, feisty, never-give-up kind of girl, just the kind we like here\nat US. She fights every second of every round. We hope she will gain\nexperience and someday get a shot at the title herself. Until then, there will be a\nlot of getting fucked like a slut on the mat.",
