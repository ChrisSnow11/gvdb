  "description": "Plan A is to have a dom work over Patrick Rouge and newcomer Tommy Defendi. Tommy is more of a top but he's new to bondage, so he's willing to sub once to see what it's like. But on the morning of the shoot, our dom is a no-show. Since Tommy has no dom training, I decide to step in and save the shoot: Plan B. Sure, bondage is hot, but I also love messing with the subs' heads, as you'll see in this update. I also like to give them options: \"Where do you want me to hit you? Here? There?\" It keeps them focused and out of their headspace and prevents them from \"leaving the room.\" There are a million doms out there and each has their own style. I like my sessions to be sensual, erotic, and firm. And as Daddy Zeus from Zeus Studios suggests, \"Stop saying 'Good Boy.' \" It's a damn hard habit to break after ten plus years. Sincerely, Van Darkholme",
