  "description": "Beretta James is ranked the #1 feather weight contender for season 11. Her partner today is rookie, Luna Light. At 4'9 and 93lbs, Luna Light is the smallest girl ever to grace the US mats. Beretta has enough skill to carry them both to victory as long as Luna doesn't get trapped in Lyla Storms long strong legs.\nLyla Storm has been Killing it this season. She's learned to use her long legs to wrap girls up and she's been climbing up the rankings. Her partner today is no slouch either. Juliette March is small but she likes to scramble. Both these girls are ruthless and refuse to lose. This could be big trouble for our tiny pistols.",
