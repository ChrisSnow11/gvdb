  "description": "Apparently there is the idea floating around out there that if a guy sucks your dick, you are still straight. The same seems to apply to fucking. If you are the one fucking the guy, then your still straight. Whatever... If thats what I need a straight guy to think in order for him to get with a dude, FINE. Whatever you say buddy. YOU ARE STRAIGHT. Spring break is coming up shortly and everyone is broke. Still toasted, they are back at the room where the guy who seems to be the alpha male gets an an idea. He decides to convince his buddy, the poor, unsuspecting roommate, Jake, to call over a guy they know that is gay, and have him suck them off on camera, and sell it to us for 10,000 dollars. After a lot of poking and prodding, Jake is convinced to give it a try. Their dude arrives and yes, while he seems quite the look on his face when they tell him what they want, he is obviously in heaven. Before I leave you alone, I will point out one thing as food for thought. The guy that was trying to sell it, seems to be the one that gets his dick sucked most of the time. Jake who was resistant, manages to spend most of his time holding onto the camera. I will let you guess which of these two well endowed hot boys blows a huge load at the end....So maybe this was all for the money....but maybe not. Im not so convinced.",
